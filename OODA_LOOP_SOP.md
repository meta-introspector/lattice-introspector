The OODA Loop is a four-stage decision-making framework—Observe, Orient, Decide, Act—developed by US Air Force Colonel John Boyd for rapid and effective decision-making in competitive, dynamic environments. It involves continuously gathering information (Observe), understanding its context and implications (Orient), forming a plan (Decide), and executing it (Act), with the goal of outmaneuvering opponents by processing the loop faster than them. While originating in military strategy, the OODA Loop is now widely applied in business, law enforcement, sports, and other fields. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

The Four Stages of the OODA Loop 

1. Observe: Gather information from all senses about the current situation, opportunities, and threats in your environment. [2, 4]  
2. Orient: Analyze, contextualize, and interpret the gathered information using your unique knowledge, experience, and mental models. This is considered the most critical stage, as it shapes how you understand the situation. [2, 4, 6]  
3. Decide: Based on your orientation, make a choice about the course of action, whether it's taking a specific action or choosing to pause and gather more information. [2, 4, 6]  
4. Act: Implement your decision by taking concrete steps. The results of this action then feed back into the observation phase, continuing the loop. [2, 4, 6]  

Why It's Called a "Loop" 
The OODA Loop is a continuous, iterative cycle, not a single, one-off event. Each action taken provides new information and context, requiring the process to start again. [2, 4, 6]  
Key Principles 

• Speed and Adaptation: The core concept is to process the OODA loop faster than your opponent, allowing you to adapt more quickly and gain an advantage. [2, 3]  
• Context is Crucial: The "Orient" stage highlights the importance of understanding the context and your own capabilities, filtering information through your unique perspective. [2, 6]  
• Beyond Warfare: While born from military strategy, its effectiveness in complex and changing situations has led to its use in many domains, from business and cybersecurity to emergency response and sports. [3, 7]
