# The Univalent Lattice Project

This repository houses the "Univalent Lattice" project, an ambitious computational framework designed to model "the entire universe of universes" by blurring the lines between code, data, and emergent meaning. It aims for extreme modularity, computational self-awareness, and verifiable truth.

For a detailed review of the project's core concepts, implementation highlights, and philosophical underpinnings, please refer to [PROJECT_REVIEW.md](PROJECT_REVIEW.md).

## Project Structure and Overview

### Development Notes and Fixed Points

*   **`prime_resonance_23.json` Removal:** The `prime_resonance_23.json` file, previously located in `.gemini/prime_resonances/`, was removed due to its excessive size (approximately 100MB) and its tendency to self-index, leading to an uncontrolled growth in size. This behavior was contrary to the project's goal of creating "fixed points that get smaller" or converge.
*   **Fixed Point Concept - Meta Slime Simulation:** To explore the concept of "fixed points that get smaller" or converge, a new Rust implementation has been introduced. This code simulates a "meta slime" behavior, where a system iteratively refines its state based on feedback, aiming for a stable, minimal configuration. This serves as a computational metaphor for finding optimal or convergent states within the lattice, contrasting with the divergent behavior observed with `prime_resonance_23.json`. The core idea is to model systems that, through iterative processes, reduce complexity or converge towards a stable, desired state rather than expanding indefinitely.


This project is organized into several key directories and top-level files, each contributing to the overall vision of a self-aware, evolving codebase.

### `lattice/` Directory

This directory contains the core Rust crates that form the foundational "genesis block" of the Univalent Lattice. For a detailed overview of the crates within this directory, please refer to [lattice/README.md](lattice/README.md).

*   **`lattice/construction/`:** This crate serves as the foundational "genesis block" for modeling computational context. It includes `build.rs` for generating lattice registration code and `src/` containing core models for static code elements, compilation dynamics, program execution, compiler IR, and VM context. It also contains `PLAN.md` and `PROOF.md` related to the self-proving statement.
*   **`lattice/construction-build-utils/`:** A utility crate used during the build process to generate Rust code for registering lattice points, managing the self-proving statement step count, and updating documentation.
*   **`lattice/lattice-analyzer/`:** Contains tools for analyzing the lattice, particularly for comparing predicted versus actual execution points.
*   **`lattice/lattice-introspector/`:** Provides introspection capabilities to parse Rust code items (structs, enums) and Markdown documents, converting their metadata into `LatticePoint` representations.
*   **`lattice/lattice-macros/`:** Houses procedural macros, specifically `LatticePointDerive`, which automatically generates `LatticePoint` instances for Rust structs and enums.
*   **`lattice/lattice-macros-test/`:** A test harness for the `lattice-macros` crate, used to verify the functionality of the procedural macros.
*   **`lattice/lattice-types/`:** Defines the core data structures for the lattice, including the `LatticePointKind` enum and the `LatticePoint` struct, which represent entities within the univalent lattice.

### `ontology/` Directory

This directory contains Markdown files defining key figures and concepts relevant to the project's theoretical underpinnings, particularly in the fields of computer science, mathematics, and philosophy.

*   **`ontology/authors/`:** Contains individual Markdown files for influential authors and thinkers (e.g., Alan Turing, Kurt GÃ¶del, Bartosz Milewski), often including their contributions and associated "emoji vectors."
