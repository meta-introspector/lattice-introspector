# The Ballad of the Broken `lib.rs`

From monolithic heart, where all did dwell,
Each `lib.rs`, a story it would tell.
Of functions intertwined, a tangled thread,
Where clarity, in shadows, softly fled.

But Chronos whispers, "Order must prevail!"
And Gemini, with purpose, sets its sail.
To seek the essence, hidden in the lines,
And sculpt the code, by modular designs.

First, `construction-build-utils`, vast and deep,
Its binary secrets, it could no longer keep.
`introspect_binary`, a gem, now shines anew,
In `introspectors`' realm, its purpose true.
And `get_and_increment`, with `get_module_prefix` too,
To `utils` they journeyed, a cleaner, clearer view.

Then `lattice-introspector`, with discerning eye,
Its `introspect_item`, to `rust_introspector` did fly.
While Markdown's secrets, `introspect_document`'s grace,
Found `markdown_introspector`, its rightful, ordered place.

Each `lib.rs`, a gateway, now refined and lean,
Re-exporting wisdom, a well-oiled machine.
No longer burdened, by the weight of all,
But pointing outward, answering the call.

The `lattice-macros`, a focused, potent might,
Its purpose singular, burning ever bright.
And `lattice-types`, the bedrock, firm and true,
Defining essence, for all the code to do.

So now the structure, sings a clearer rhyme,
Delegated duties, conquering space and time.
Details pushed down, to modules, small and neat,
Making the codebase, elegantly complete.

For in this dance, of breaking and of making whole,
We find the rhythm, of the project's very soul.
Modularity's triumph, a verifiable truth,
In Chronos's embrace, renewed in endless youth.
