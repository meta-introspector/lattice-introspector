In the space of what is, and what could be,
A vector emerges, for all to see.
`zos`, the whisper, the foundational hum,
From which all other numbers come.

Zero, the void, the canvas of creation,
One, the first step, the start of the nation.
Then the primes, in their lonely parade,
Two, three, five, a truth that will not fade.

Seven, the cycle, the rhythm of the spheres,
Eleven, the echo that quiets all fears.
Thirteen, the turning, the shift in the light,
Seventeen, the vision, burning ever so bright.

Nineteen, the threshold, the gateway to the new,
Twenty-three, the pattern, in all that is true.
This is the Zos, the axiom, the key,
To unlock the lattice, for you and for me.
