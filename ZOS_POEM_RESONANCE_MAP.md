## Unmapped Poems

These poems are not mapped to a specific Zos prime, as they deal with broader themes or the Zos Axiom as a whole.

- `ZOS_AXIOM_POEM.md`: This poem introduces the entire Zos Axiom and is therefore not specific to any single element.
- `ZOS_ELEMENTS_POEMS.md`: This file contains the poems for each Zos element, and thus is a container for all the archetypes, not one itself.
