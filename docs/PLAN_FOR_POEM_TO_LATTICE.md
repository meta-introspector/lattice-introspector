## Plan: Turning the Poem Back into the Lattice and into Rust

This document outlines the plan for integrating the Zos Axiom poem and its elements more deeply into the Univalent Lattice project, culminating in the generation of Rust code.

### Phase 1: Representing Poem Elements as Lattice Points

-   **Objective:** Create `LatticePoint`s for each numerical element of the Zos poem, capturing their "vibe" and establishing relationships to their corresponding Zos prime `GodelianTruth` points.
-   **Status (as of last interaction):**
    -   `ZosPoemElement` `LatticePointKind` has been added to `lattice-types/src/lib.rs`.
    -   `zos_mapper.rs` in `construction-build-utils` has been modified to generate `LatticePoint`s for each Zos element (0, 1, 2, 3, 5, etc.) with `ZosPoemElement` kind, including their "vibe" descriptions as metadata and relating them to their Zos prime `GodelianTruth` points.
    -   `ZOS_AXIOM_POEM.md` has been added to the `markdown_paths` in `construction/build.rs` to ensure it's introspected as a `MarkdownDocument` `LatticePoint`.
-   **Verification (Next Steps):**
    -   Run `cargo check` to ensure all recent code changes compile without errors.
    -   Run `cargo run -p lattice-macros-test` to execute the test binary.
    -   Inspect the generated `.gemini/lattice_events` JSON files (specifically the `actual_execution_*.json` and `trace_event_*.json` files) to confirm that the new `ZosPoemElement` `LatticePoint`s are correctly generated with their metadata and relationships.

### Phase 2: Generating Rust Code from the Lattice

-   **Objective:** Develop mechanisms to transform the lattice representation of the poem into executable Rust code. This could involve generating data structures, functions, or even entire modules that reflect the poem's structure and meaning.
-   **Potential Actions:**
    -   **Define Rust Mappings:** Establish clear mappings between `LatticePoint` kinds (especially `ZosPoemElement` and related `GodelianTruth` points) and corresponding Rust constructs (e.g., enums, structs, constants, functions).
    -   **Code Generation Logic:** Implement code generation logic within `construction-build-utils` (or a new dedicated crate) that traverses the lattice and emits Rust code based on the defined mappings. This might involve using Rust's `proc_macro` capabilities or a simple string-based code generation approach.
    -   **Integrate with Build Process:** Ensure the Rust code generation is integrated into the existing `build.rs` process, so that the Rust code is automatically generated and compiled as part of the project.
    -   **Testing Generated Code:** Write unit and integration tests for the generated Rust code to ensure its correctness and adherence to the poem's intended logic.

### Phase 3: Deeper Integration and Poetic Interpretation (Future Work)

-   **Objective:** Explore more nuanced ways to represent the poem within the lattice, potentially capturing its narrative flow, metaphorical connections, or even generating new poetic expressions based on lattice states.
-   **Potential Actions:**
    -   Develop a mechanism to represent the *structure* of the poem (e.g., stanzas, lines) as `LatticePoint`s, with relationships defining their order and hierarchy.
    -   Implement a "poetic transformation" that can analyze the "vibe" of different parts of the lattice and generate new poetic text.
    -   Create a visualization tool that can render the poem's `LatticePoint`s and their relationships, allowing for a visual exploration of the "rhyme of the lattice."
