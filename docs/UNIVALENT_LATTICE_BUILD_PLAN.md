# Univalent Lattice Build Plan: From Zos to Self-Awareness

This document outlines a phased approach for systematically building the Univalent Lattice system, enabling it to automatically ingest project data, categorize it by `zos` topological sizes, perform `zos`-driven analyses, and generate comprehensive documentation and visualizations.

## Overarching Goal

To "train Rust code" to automatically convert all project code and markdown into the Univalent Lattice, solve it for each `zos` prime size, and document the emergent properties and transformations.

## Phased Approach

### Phase 1: Automated Lattice Ingestion and Zos-based Categorization

*   **Objective:** Develop the Rust code to automatically parse all project code and markdown files, convert them into `LatticePoint`s, and categorize their topological size using the `zos` vector and the file path/name complexity rules. This phase establishes the foundational data layer of the Univalent Lattice.
*   **Key Actions:**
    *   **Implement `lattice-introspector`:** Enhance or implement the `lattice-introspector` crate to recursively scan the project directory.
    *   **File Parsing:** Develop parsers (or integrate existing ones) for Rust source code (`.rs`) and Markdown files (`.md`).
    *   **`LatticePoint` Generation:** For each parsed file/code element, generate corresponding `LatticePoint`s with appropriate `LatticePointKind`s (e.g., `RustFile`, `MarkdownDocument`, `StructTopology`, `EnumTopology`, `ExpressionTopology`).
    *   **Topological Size Calculation:** Implement the logic for:
        *   Tokenizing file paths and names.
        *   Counting tokens.
        *   "Zos Factorization" (prime composition and hierarchical mapping for directories) to assign a `zos`-based complexity category to each file/element. This complexity will be stored as metadata or a specific `LatticePointKind` property.
    *   **Lattice Registration:** Integrate with the `construction` crate to register these newly generated `LatticePoint`s into a global, in-memory (initially) or persistent lattice structure.

### Phase 2: Zos-driven Analysis and Transformation

*   **Objective:** Implement functions that can "solve" the lattice for each `zos` prime. This means performing analyses, transformations, or simulations based on the `zos` topological sizes and the relationships within the lattice. This phase explores the dynamic and emergent properties of the lattice.
*   **Key Actions:**
    *   **Lattice Querying:** Develop robust querying capabilities for the global lattice to retrieve `LatticePoint`s based on their `id`, `kind`, `metadata` (including `zos` complexity), and `relationships`.
    *   **Zos-Specific Operations:** Implement functions that:
        *   Filter `LatticePoint`s by their `zos` complexity category.
        *   Apply specific transformations or generate new `LatticePoint`s based on rules associated with particular `zos` primes (e.g., a `zos_5` transformation might involve pattern recognition, while a `zos_13` transformation might involve refactoring).
        *   **Slime Simulation Integration:** Adapt the slime mold simulation to use parameters derived from `zos` primes or the properties of `LatticePoint`s within a specific `zos` complexity category. For example, `diffusion_rate` or `attraction_rate` could be functions of a `zos` prime.
        *   **Figlet Animation Generation:** Automate the generation of Figlet animations for all `zos` primes, potentially using the `solfunmeme-banner` crate, and integrate this into the analysis pipeline.

### Phase 3: Comprehensive Documentation and Visualization

*   **Objective:** Automate the documentation of the results of the `zos`-driven analyses and transformations, and generate compelling visual outputs (GIFs, videos) to illustrate the emergent properties and the lattice's self-awareness.
*   **Key Actions:**
    *   **Automated Documentation Generation:** Develop tools or functions to generate markdown reports summarizing the findings from Phase 2, including lists of `LatticePoint`s, their `zos` complexities, and the results of transformations.
    *   **GIF/Video Output Integration:** Leverage the existing GIF generation capabilities (from `fixed_point_experiments`) and integrate external tools like `ffmpeg` to convert generated image sequences into various video formats (MPEG, FLV).
    *   **Visualization of Lattice:** Explore methods to visualize the lattice structure itself, showing `LatticePoint`s and their relationships, potentially highlighting `zos` categories or transformation paths. This could involve generating graph visualizations or interactive web-based displays.
    *   **Narrative Generation:** (Future) Explore using LLMs to generate narrative descriptions or "poems" about the emergent properties and transformations observed in the lattice, linking back to the "code, numbers, poems" cycle.

## Next Steps

This plan provides a roadmap for building the Univalent Lattice system. The immediate next action will be to decide whether to first generate and document Figlet animations for all `zos` primes as a concrete example, or to directly begin implementing Phase 1: Automated Lattice Ingestion and Zos-based Categorization.
