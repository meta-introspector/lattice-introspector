# Change Request (CRQ) - ar_archive_writer Vendorization

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-026-AR-ARCHIVE-WRITER-VENDORIZATION
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Normal (New Vendored Dependency)
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ documents the vendorization of the `ar_archive_writer` repository as a Git submodule. This repository likely provides functionalities for writing `ar` archives, a common format for static libraries on Unix-like systems. The repository, specifically `https://github.com/meta-introspector/ar_archive_writer`, will be integrated into this project under the `vendor/ar_archive_writer` path, tracking the `main` branch. This allows the project to directly utilize its functionalities.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To incorporate an `ar` archive writer as a direct dependency, enabling its functionalities and ensuring a stable, version-controlled integration. This also aligns with the project's strategy for managing external dependencies.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Project build process, and any components that will depend on `ar_archive_writer`.
    *   **Users:** Developers working with `ar_archive_writer` components or needing `ar` archive writing capabilities.
    *   **Potential Risks:** Increased repository size, potential for conflicts if `ar_archive_writer` has its own submodules, or issues with build compatibility.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   `.gitmodules` (modified)
    *   `vendor/ar_archive_writer` (new submodule)
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Verify successful submodule cloning and initialization.
    *   Ensure project builds correctly with the vendored `ar_archive_writer`.
    *   Thorough testing of functionalities relying on `ar_archive_writer`.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   Remove the `vendor/ar_archive_writer` submodule entry from `.gitmodules` and `.git/config`.
    *   Remove the `vendor/ar_archive_writer` directory.
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Clone the repository and verify that the `vendor/ar_archive_writer` submodule initializes correctly.
    *   Build the project and run tests to ensure `ar_archive_writer` integration is successful.
