# Change Request (CRQ) - Blinkenlights Simulation Development & Testing

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-003-BLINKENLIGHTS-DEV-TEST
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Normal (Feature Development, Scripting & Testing)
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ documents significant development and testing activities related to the `ultimate_blinkenlights_simulation`. It includes modifications to the core Rust application (`main.rs`), the introduction of a new execution script (`run_blinkenlights.sh`) for basic runs, and a comprehensive test driver script (`run_test_driver.sh`). The test driver utilizes `generate_prime_resonances.py` to dynamically determine simulation step limits, and logs detailed traces into `test_traces_primes/`. Additionally, `blinkenlights_output.log` captures general simulation output, and `test_traces/` likely contains other test-related artifacts. These changes collectively enhance the simulation's functionality, automation, and testability.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    These changes are part of ongoing feature development, automation, and testing efforts for the blinkenlights simulation. This CRQ serves to formally document these related changes post-implementation to ensure compliance with change management procedures.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** `ultimate_blinkenlights_simulation` application, its build and execution processes, and automated testing infrastructure.
    *   **Users:** Developers and users involved in developing, running, or testing the blinkenlights simulation.
    *   **Potential Risks:** Introduction of bugs in simulation logic, issues with script execution, incorrect test data generation, or performance regressions if not properly reviewed and tested.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   `crates/ultimate_blinkenlights_simulation/src/main.rs` (modified)
    *   `generate_prime_resonances.py` (modified)
    *   `run_blinkenlights.sh` (new)
    *   `run_test_driver.sh` (new)
    *   `blinkenlights_output.log` (new, generated)
    *   `test_traces/` (new, generated directory)
    *   `test_traces_primes/` (new, generated directory)
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Thorough code review of `main.rs`, `run_blinkenlights.sh`, `run_test_driver.sh`, and `generate_prime_resonances.py`.
    *   Comprehensive testing of the simulation with various step limits and scenarios.
    *   Verification of script execution, output logging, and test trace generation.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   Revert changes to `crates/ultimate_blinkenlights_simulation/src/main.rs` and `generate_prime_resonances.py`.
    *   Remove `run_blinkenlights.sh`, `run_test_driver.sh`, `blinkenlights_output.log`, `test_traces/`, and `test_traces_primes/`. (Note: These will be ignored by git after .gitignore update)
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Execute `run_blinkenlights.sh` and verify its output.
    *   Execute `run_test_driver.sh` and verify the generated `test_traces_primes/` logs.
    *   Inspect the contents of `test_traces/` for consistency and correctness.
    *   Run the `ultimate_blinkenlights_simulation` directly to confirm its behavior.
