# Change Request (CRQ) - Blinkenlights Simulation Development

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-002-BLINKENLIGHTS-DEV
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Normal (Feature Development & Enhancement)
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ covers the initial development and subsequent enhancement of the ultimate blinkenlights simulation. This includes the introduction of its core logic, new Rust modules for configuration, image utilities, and slime mold simulation, along with the main application entry point. It also encompasses the implementation of the `--step-limit` argument using the `clap` library for controlling simulation duration, and related documentation updates.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    These development efforts were undertaken without a formal CRQ process, leading to a compliance gap. This consolidated CRQ serves to formally document these related changes post-implementation to bring them into compliance with change management procedures.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Core `ultimate_blinkenlights_simulation` functionality, its command-line interface, and associated documentation.
    *   **Users:** Developers and users interacting with the blinkenlights simulation.
    *   **Potential Risks:** Introduction of bugs, performance regressions, or issues with argument parsing if not properly reviewed and tested.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   `crates/ultimate_blinkenlights_simulation/Cargo.toml`
    *   `crates/ultimate_blinkenlights_simulation/src/config.rs`
    *   `crates/ultimate_blinkenlights_simulation/src/image_utils.rs`
    *   `crates/ultimate_blinkenlights_simulation/src/main.rs`
    *   `crates/ultimate_blinkenlights_simulation/src/slime_mold.rs`
    *   `ultimate_blinkenlights_simulation.md`
    *   `docs/sops/devops_review_blinkenlights.md`
*   **Associated Commits:**
    *   `d11dbae4d180ab6e8042d83d719be58773797402`: Add ultimate blinkenlights simulation and documentation.
    *   `b9877dee70777e6eee304e18dc916a35a64cddf1`: Implement --step-limit argument using clap in blinkenlights simulation.
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Thorough code review of all affected Rust modules and documentation.
    *   Comprehensive testing of the simulation's core logic and command-line arguments.
    *   Verification of documentation accuracy and completeness.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   `git revert b9877dee70777e6eee304e18dc916a35a64cddf1` (to revert step-limit)
    *   `git revert d11dbae4d180ab6e8042d83d719be58773797402` (to revert initial simulation)
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Run the blinkenlights simulation with various configurations and step limits.
    *   Confirm expected behavior and output.
    *   Verify that all new and modified files function as intended.
    *   Check the documentation for clarity and accuracy.
