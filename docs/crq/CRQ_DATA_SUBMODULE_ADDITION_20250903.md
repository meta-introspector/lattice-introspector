# Change Request (CRQ) - Data Submodule Addition

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-008-DATA-SUBMODULE-ADDITION
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Normal (New Submodule)
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ documents the addition of the `data/` directory as a Git submodule, linking it to the Hugging Face repository `https://huggingface.co/datasets/introspector/meta-memes`. This change allows the `data/` directory, containing assets for the meme generator (e.g., ASCII art variants and slime run animations), to be managed as an independent repository while being integrated into the main project.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To externalize and manage large data assets more efficiently, enabling independent versioning and easier updates for the meme generator's assets. This CRQ serves to formally document its addition to ensure compliance with change management procedures.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Git repository structure, build processes (if they rely on submodule initialization), and the meme generator functionality.
    *   **Users:** Developers working with the `data/` assets, and users of the meme generator.
    *   **Potential Risks:** Issues with submodule cloning/updating, or incorrect asset paths if not properly configured.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   `.gitmodules` (modified)
    *   `data/` (new submodule)
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Verify successful submodule initialization and content retrieval.
    *   Ensure build and runtime processes correctly access submodule content.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   Remove the `data/` submodule entry from `.gitmodules` and `.git/config`.
    *   Remove the `data/` directory.
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Clone the repository and verify that the `data/` submodule initializes correctly.
    *   Run the meme generator to ensure it can access and utilize the assets from the submodule.
