# CRQ: Formal Arithmetization of CRQs for ZKP and Social Meme Proofs

**Date:** 2025-09-08

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a highly ambitious project to formally arithmetize the content of existing CRQ (Change Request Qualification) documents. The goal is to transform the textual information within CRQs into a numerical, formally verifiable representation using prime numbers and Lean 4, ultimately enabling Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and facilitating an "intuitive or social meme proof" of complex system properties.

## 2. Core Concepts and Methodology

### 2.1. Prime Concepts and Gödel Numbering

*   **Prime Concepts:** Each fundamental, irreducible concept identified within the CRQ corpus will be designated as a "prime concept." The identification of these prime concepts will be a critical initial step, likely requiring a combination of automated analysis and expert human curation.
*   **Prime Number Assignment:** Each unique prime concept will be assigned a unique prime number. This assignment will be systematic and documented.
*   **Compound Concepts Arithmetization:** Compound concepts, relationships, and statements will be represented numerically through a form of Gödel numbering or polynomial commitment. This will typically involve multiplying the prime numbers of their constituent prime concepts. For example, if concept A is assigned prime `p_A` and concept B is assigned `p_B`, a compound concept "A relates to B" might be represented by `p_A * p_B` or a more complex polynomial.

### 2.2. Lean 4 Formalization

*   **CRQ as Lean 4 Expressions:** The arithmetized CRQ content will be translated into Lean 4 expressions, types, and values. This will involve defining Lean 4 data structures and functions that mirror the numerical encoding.
*   **Formal Proofs:** Lean 4 will be used to construct formal proofs about the properties and relationships expressed within the arithmetized CRQs. These proofs will leverage the numerical representation to reason about the system's qualifications and changes.

### 2.3. Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)

*   **Proof Generation:** The numerical and formal representation of CRQs will serve as the basis for generating Zero-Knowledge Proofs. This will allow parties to prove certain properties about the CRQs (e.g., a specific change was qualified, a certain security property holds) without revealing the underlying sensitive details of the CRQ content.
*   **Verifiable Computation:** The arithmetization enables verifiable computation over the CRQ data, which is a prerequisite for many ZKP schemes.

### 2.4. Intuitive / Social Meme Proof

*   **Abstraction and Simplification:** The ultimate goal is to translate complex formal and ZKP-based proofs into a form that is intuitively understandable and shareable, akin to a "social meme." This involves identifying key verifiable properties and presenting them in a highly accessible and compelling manner, without compromising the underlying formal rigor.

## 3. Methodology and Steps

1.  **CRQ Corpus Collection:** Read and parse all existing CRQ documents from the designated directory.
2.  **Prime Concept Identification:** Develop a methodology (manual, semi-automated, or LLM-assisted) to identify the atomic "prime concepts" within the CRQ text.
3.  **Prime Number Assignment:** Assign unique prime numbers to each identified prime concept.
4.  **Arithmetization Scheme Design:** Define the rules for numerically encoding compound concepts, relationships, and statements using the assigned prime numbers (e.g., Gödel numbering, polynomial commitment).
5.  **Lean 4 Mapping:** Develop Lean 4 code to represent the arithmetized CRQ data as Lean 4 expressions, types, and values.
6.  **Formal Proof Development:** Write Lean 4 proofs to verify properties and relationships within the arithmetized CRQ data.
7.  **ZKP Integration Strategy:** Explore and select appropriate ZKP schemes that can operate on the arithmetized CRQ data and formal proofs.
8.  **Social Meme Proof Generation:** Develop methods for abstracting and visualizing the verifiable properties for intuitive understanding and dissemination.

## 4. Challenges

*   **Ambiguity in Natural Language:** Identifying precise "prime concepts" from natural language text is inherently challenging.
*   **Complexity of Formalization:** Translating complex CRQ logic into rigorous Lean 4 proofs and numerical representations will be a significant undertaking.
*   **Scalability:** Ensuring the arithmetization and ZKP generation scales to a large corpus of CRQs.
*   **Bridging Formal and Intuitive:** The gap between formal proofs and intuitive understanding is vast and requires innovative approaches.

## 5. Immediate Next Action

To begin, the immediate next action is to **read the content of all existing CRQ files** in the directory `/data/data/com.termux.nix/files/home/pick-up-nix/source/github/meta-introspector/lattice-introspector/docs/crq/` to initiate the "CRQ Corpus Collection" step.
