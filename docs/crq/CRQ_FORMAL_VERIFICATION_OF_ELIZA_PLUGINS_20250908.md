# CRQ: Formal Verification of ElizaOS Plugins

**Date:** 2025-09-08

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a formal plan for the verification and multi-target code generation of ElizaOS plugins. The goal is to establish a robust, formally verifiable pipeline that transforms an ElizaOS plugin into a formally proven Lean 4 model, and subsequently generates correct code for various target platforms (Rust, eBPF, WASM), with the assistance of Large Language Models (LLMs).

## 2. Mathematical Formulation

Let:
*   `PLS` be the set of all ElizaOS Plugins available in the registry (`https://elizaos-plugins.github.io/registry/`).
*   `P` be an element of `PLS` (i.e., `P âˆˆ PLS`).
*   `f` be the function that takes a plugin `P` and transforms it.
*   `LLM` denote the assistance provided by a Large Language Model.
*   `Rust` represent the Rust programming language.
*   `Lean4` represent the Lean 4 theorem prover and programming language.
*   `LLVM` represent the LLVM Intermediate Representation.
*   `MiniZinc` represent the MiniZinc constraint modeling language.

The function `f` can be defined as:

$$ 
f: PLS \to (\text{Lean4Proof} \times \text{RustCode} \times \text{LLVMIR} \times \text{MiniZincModel}) $$

And its application for a given plugin `P` is:

$$ f(P) = \text{LLM_assisted_transformation}(P, \text{Rust}, \text{Lean4}, \text{LLVM}, \text{MiniZinc}) $$

Where `LLM_assisted_transformation` is a complex process that involves:

1.  **Formalization in Lean 4:** Deriving a formal model and proofs (`Lean4Proof`) of `P`'s behavior and properties. This is the primary output of the formal verification aspect.
2.  **Code Generation:** Generating executable code in `RustCode` and `LLVMIR` from the formal model.
3.  **Constraint Modeling:** Generating a `MiniZincModel` that formally specifies the constraints or properties of `P`.
4.  **LLM Assistance:** The `LLM` acts as a heuristic guide throughout these transformations, suggesting patterns, assisting with formalizations, and potentially optimizing the generated code/models, but its output is allways subject to formal verification by Lean 4.

## 3. Formal Plan: ElizaOS Plugin Formalization and Multi-Target Code Generation (Generic Plugin P)

### I. Current State (Inputs - "x", "y", "z" of our S-combinator):

*   **x: ElizaOS Plugin P (from `https://elizaos-plugins.github.io/registry/`)**
    *   Source code (Rust, etc.)
    *   Associated documentation, tests, build scripts.
    *   Located at: `source/github/meta-introspector/streamofrandom/vendor/livestream-plugin-P/` (once fetched).
*   **y: Lean 4 Environment**
    *   Lean 4 compiler, theorem prover, and associated tools.
    *   Libraries for formalizing programming language semantics, type theory, etc.
*   **z: Target Language/Platform Specifications**
    *   Rust language specification.
    *   eBPF instruction set architecture (ISA) specification.
    *   WASM specification.
    *   LLVM IR specification (as an intermediate representation).
    *   LLM capabilities (for assistance, not as a core formal component).

### II. Desired Outcome (Output of our S-combinator):

*   **Formally Verified Lean 4 Model of Plugin P:**
    *   A Lean 4 representation of Plugin P's behavior, types, and properties.
    *   Proofs of correctness for critical aspects of Plugin P's logic.
*   **Generated Code for Multiple Targets:**
    *   Rust implementation (derived from the Lean 4 model).
    *   eBPF bytecode (derived from the Lean 4 model).
    *   WASM bytecode (derived from the Lean 4 model).
*   **Formal Mapping/Translation Proofs:**
    *   Lean 4 proofs demonstrating that the generated code correctly implements the formal model.

### III. Formal Steps (The "f" function):

1.  **Plugin Ingestion and Initial Representation (P -> P'):**
    *   **Action:** Fetch the source code for a specified Plugin `P` from its repository (as listed in `https://elizaos-plugins.github.io/registry/`) into a designated vendor directory (e.g., `source/github/meta-introspector/streamofrandom/vendor/livestream-plugin-P/`).
    *   **Formalization:** Define a formal representation `P'` of Plugin P's source code within Lean 4. This might involve parsing the Rust code and representing its Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) or a more abstract intermediate representation in Lean 4.
    *   **Verification Goal:** Prove that `P'` accurately reflects the syntax and structure of `P`.

2.  **Behavioral Formalization (P' -> M):**
    *   **Action:** Analyze Plugin P's functionality.
    *   **Formalization:** Develop a formal semantic model `M` of Plugin P's behavior in Lean 4. This `M` will capture the input-output relationships, state changes, and properties of the plugin.
    *   **Verification Goal:** Prove that `M` correctly describes the intended behavior of Plugin P as observed from `P'`. This might involve proving properties about `M` that correspond to the plugin's specifications.

3.  **Target Language Specification Formalization (T_rust, T_ebpf, T_wasm):**
    *   **Action:** (Ongoing/Pre-existing) Formalize the semantics of Rust, eBPF, and WASM within Lean 4. This involves defining their type systems, operational semantics, and memory models.
    *   **Formalization:** Create formal specifications `T_rust`, `T_ebpf`, `T_wasm` in Lean 4.
    *   **Verification Goal:** Ensure these formalizations are consistent and accurate representations of the target languages.

4.  **Code Generation and Translation Proof (M -> C_target):**
    *   **Action:** Implement a code generator within Lean 4 (or a verified external tool) that takes the formal model `M` and produces code `C_target` for each target (Rust, eBPF, WASM).
    *   **Formalization:** Define the translation function `translate_M_to_C(M, T_target) : C_target`.
    *   **Verification Goal:** Prove that `translate_M_to_C(M, T_target)` is *correct* with respect to `M` and `T_target`. That is, prove that the generated code `C_target` behaves according to the formal model `M` when executed on the `T_target` platform.

5.  **LLM Integration (Assistance, not Formal Core):**
    *   **Action:** Use LLMs to assist in steps 1, 2, and 4. For example, suggesting initial formalizations, identifying invariants, or proposing code generation patterns.
    *   **Formalization:** The LLM's output would be treated as a *suggestion* that must then be formally verified by Lean 4. It's a heuristic aid, not a source of truth.

### IV. Iteration and Refinement:

*   This is an iterative process. Each step will likely reveal complexities that require refinement of previous steps.

### V. Immediate Next Action:

The very first concrete action is to fetch the `elizaos-plugins.github.io/registry/` to identify a specific plugin `P` and its repository URL. Once we have that, we can proceed with cloning it.
