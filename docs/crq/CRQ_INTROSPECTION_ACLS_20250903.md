# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: ACLs (Access Control Lists)

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-075-INTROSPECTION-ACLS
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "ACLs (Access Control Lists)" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how ACL principles and implementations might apply to or inform the project's security model, data access control, or resource management. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for leveraging ACLs for fine-grained permission management and robust security enforcement.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore access control mechanisms for potential application in building more secure and robust systems within the project, ensuring proper authorization and data protection.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future security architecture or data access patterns.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
