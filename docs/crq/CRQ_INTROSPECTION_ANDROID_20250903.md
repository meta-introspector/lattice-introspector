# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: Android

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-080-INTROSPECTION-ANDROID
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "Android" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how the Android platform (e.g., application development, SDK, NDK, deployment, ecosystem) might apply to or inform the project's mobile strategy, cross-platform compatibility, or specific mobile-oriented features. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for leveraging Android's capabilities for mobile development and deployment.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore the capabilities of the Android platform for potential mobile application development, integration, and deployment strategies within the project, ensuring efficient and reliable mobile presence.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future mobile development or deployment strategies.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
