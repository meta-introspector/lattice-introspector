# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: Archive.org

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-109-INTROSPECTION-ARCHIVE-ORG
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "Archive.org" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how Archive.org's vast digital library (e.g., Wayback Machine, digitized books, audio, video) might apply to or inform the project's data sourcing, historical analysis, or content preservation strategies. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for leveraging Archive.org as a resource for historical data and digital preservation.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore the capabilities of Archive.org for potential data sourcing, historical analysis, and content preservation within the project, enabling access to a vast and diverse digital archive.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future data sourcing or content management.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
