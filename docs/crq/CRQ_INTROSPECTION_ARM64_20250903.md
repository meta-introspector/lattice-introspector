# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: ARM64

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-079-INTROSPECTION-ARM64
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "ARM64" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how the ARM64 architecture's characteristics (e.g., instruction set, memory model, performance features) might apply to or inform the project's build targets, performance optimization, or deployment on ARM-based devices (e.g., mobile, embedded, cloud instances). The introspection aims to identify potential applications for leveraging ARM64 for efficient and optimized execution.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore the capabilities of the ARM64 architecture for potential optimization, integration, and deployment strategies within the project, ensuring efficient and reliable code execution on ARM-based platforms.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future build targets or performance optimizations.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
