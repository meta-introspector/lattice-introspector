# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: Bash

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-071-INTROSPECTION-BASH
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Codebase Analysis
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "Bash" scripting within the context of the current project. This involves analyzing existing Bash scripts for adherence to best practices, robustness, portability, and potential areas for refactoring or optimization. The introspection aims to identify opportunities for improving script quality, maintainability, and leveraging advanced Bash features or alternative scripting languages where appropriate.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To ensure the Bash scripting within the project is robust, efficient, and aligns with modern scripting standards, contributing to the overall health and reliability of automated tasks and build processes.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Existing Bash scripts and their execution.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and administrators.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is an analysis phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   All Bash script files (`.sh`), and any other files containing Bash commands.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on analysis and recommendations without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings and proposed changes clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of analysis findings and proposed improvements.
