# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: Bitcoin

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-063-INTROSPECTION-BITCOIN
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "Bitcoin" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how the principles of decentralized consensus, blockchain technology, cryptographic security, and peer-to-peer networks, as exemplified by Bitcoin, might apply to or inform the project's data integrity, distributed systems design, or security mechanisms. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for leveraging Bitcoin's core concepts for robust and trustless operations.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore the foundational concepts of decentralized digital currencies and their underlying technologies for potential application in building more secure, transparent, and resilient systems within the project.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future data integrity, distributed system design, or security features.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
