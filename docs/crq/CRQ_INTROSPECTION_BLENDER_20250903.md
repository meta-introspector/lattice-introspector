# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: Blender

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-100-INTROSPECTION-BLENDER
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "Blender" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how Blender's capabilities (e.g., 3D modeling, animation, rendering, scripting) might apply to or inform the project's visual assets, simulations, or data visualization in 3D space. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for leveraging Blender for creating high-quality 3D content and interactive experiences.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore 3D content creation tools for potential application in building more engaging and immersive visual experiences or data representations within the project.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future visual assets or simulation models.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
