# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: Blinkenlights

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-042-INTROSPECTION-BLINKENLIGHTS
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Feature Enhancement
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into the "blinkenlights" aspect of the project. This involves analyzing the existing `ultimate_blinkenlights_simulation` and related components (scripts, test traces, data assets) to understand its current capabilities, limitations, and potential for enhancement. The introspection aims to identify opportunities for new features, improved visual fidelity, performance optimizations, or integration with other project modules.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To enhance the visual feedback and interactive elements of the project, leveraging the existing blinkenlights simulation as a foundation for further development and integration.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** `ultimate_blinkenlights_simulation` module, related scripts and data.
    *   **Users:** Users interacting with visual feedback elements, developers working on simulation or visualization.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is an introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   `crates/ultimate_blinkenlights_simulation/`, `run_blinkenlights.sh`, `run_test_driver.sh`, `blinkenlights_output.log`, `test_traces/`, `test_traces_primes/`, `data/` (meme generator assets).
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on analysis and design without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings and proposed enhancements clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of analysis findings and proposed enhancements.
