# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: C4 Model

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-113-INTROSPECTION-C4
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into the "C4 Model" for software architecture within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how the C4 model's hierarchical approach to visualizing software architecture (Context, Containers, Components, Code) might apply to or inform the project's documentation, communication, or design processes. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for leveraging the C4 model for clear and consistent architectural representation.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore established architectural documentation frameworks for potential application in building more understandable and maintainable software architectures within the project, fostering better communication and collaboration.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future architectural documentation or design processes.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
