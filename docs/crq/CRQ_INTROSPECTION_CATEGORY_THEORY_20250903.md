# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: Category Theory

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-085-INTROSPECTION-CATEGORY-THEORY
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "Category Theory" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how the abstract mathematical framework of categories, functors, and natural transformations might apply to or inform the project's software architecture, data modeling, or the design of modular and composable systems. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for leveraging Category Theory for more rigorous and elegant system design.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore advanced mathematical concepts that could provide a powerful and abstract framework for understanding and designing complex software systems, potentially leading to more robust, modular, and formally verifiable architectures.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future software architecture or data modeling.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
