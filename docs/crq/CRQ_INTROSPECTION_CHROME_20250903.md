# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: Chrome

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-084-INTROSPECTION-CHROME
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "Chrome" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how Google Chrome (e.g., browser features, DevTools, extensions, web technologies) might apply to or inform the project's web-based interfaces, debugging strategies, or user experience design. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for leveraging Chrome's capabilities for web development and user interaction.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore the capabilities of the Chrome browser for potential web development, debugging, and user experience strategies within the project, ensuring efficient and reliable web presence.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future web interfaces or development tools.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
