# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: Clifford Algebra

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-050-INTROSPECTION-CLIFFORD-ALGEBRA
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "Clifford Algebra" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how the mathematical framework of Clifford algebras, which generalize complex numbers and quaternions, might apply to or inform the project's geometric computing, physics simulations, or the representation of rotations and transformations in higher dimensions. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for more unified and efficient geometric calculations.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore advanced mathematical tools that could provide a more powerful and elegant framework for geometric computations and transformations, potentially leading to more efficient algorithms or a deeper understanding of spatial relationships in data.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future geometric algorithms or simulation models.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
