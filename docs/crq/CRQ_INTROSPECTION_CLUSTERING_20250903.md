# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: Clustering

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-092-INTROSPECTION-CLUSTERING
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "Clustering" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how various clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means, DBSCAN, hierarchical clustering) might apply to or inform the project's data analysis, anomaly detection, or user segmentation. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for grouping similar data points or entities for better understanding and processing.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore data analysis techniques for potential application in building more intelligent and data-driven systems within the project, enabling the discovery of hidden patterns and relationships.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future data analysis or machine learning components.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
