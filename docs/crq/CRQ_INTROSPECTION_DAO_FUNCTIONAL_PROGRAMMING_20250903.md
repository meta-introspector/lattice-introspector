# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: Dao of Functional Programming

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-087-INTROSPECTION-DAO-FUNCTIONAL-PROGRAMMING
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into the "Dao of Functional Programming" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how the philosophical principles and practical wisdom of functional programming (e.g., immutability, pure functions, composition, referential transparency) might apply to or inform the project's software design, architecture, or development practices. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for building more robust, maintainable, and testable systems.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore the deeper principles of functional programming for potential application in building more robust, maintainable, and testable systems within the project, fostering a more elegant and efficient development approach.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future software design or development practices.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
