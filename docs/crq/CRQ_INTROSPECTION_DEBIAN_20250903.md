# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: Debian

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-106-INTROSPECTION-DEBIAN
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "Debian" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how the Debian operating system (e.g., packaging system, stable releases, community governance, adherence to FOSS principles) might apply to or inform the project's deployment, distribution, or development environment. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for leveraging Debian's robust and widely adopted ecosystem.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore the capabilities of the Debian operating system for potential deployment, distribution, and development strategies within the project, ensuring efficient and reliable system operation and broad compatibility.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future deployment strategies or development environments.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
