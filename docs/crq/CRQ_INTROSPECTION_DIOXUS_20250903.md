# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: Dioxus

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-068-INTROSPECTION-DIOXUS
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Codebase Analysis
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "Dioxus" within the context of the current project. This involves analyzing the existing usage of the Dioxus framework (e.g., in `solfunmeme-dioxus`) for building user interfaces. The introspection aims to understand its current implementation, adherence to best practices, performance characteristics, and potential for broader application or integration within the project.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To ensure optimal utilization of the Dioxus framework, identify areas for improvement, and explore its potential for expanding UI development within the project.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Existing Dioxus-based UI components.
    *   **Users:** Developers working with Dioxus.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is an analysis phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   `vendor/solfunmeme-dioxus`, and any other Dioxus-related code.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on analysis and recommendations without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings and proposed changes clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of analysis findings and proposed improvements.
