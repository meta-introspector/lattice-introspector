# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: Docker

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-073-INTROSPECTION-DOCKER
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "Docker" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how containerization principles and Docker's ecosystem (e.g., Dockerfiles, images, containers, Docker Compose, registries) might apply to or inform the project's development environment, testing, deployment, or microservices architecture. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for leveraging Docker for consistent, isolated, and portable environments.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore containerization solutions for potential application in building more consistent, isolated, and portable development and deployment environments within the project.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future development workflows or deployment strategies.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
