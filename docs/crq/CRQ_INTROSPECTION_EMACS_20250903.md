# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: Emacs

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-060-INTROSPECTION-EMACS
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "Emacs" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how the principles of Emacs (e.g., extensibility, self-documentation, integrated development environment, Lisp-based customization) might apply to or inform the project's tooling, development environment, or user interface design. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for leveraging Emacs' strengths in creating highly customizable and powerful development workflows.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore advanced development environment paradigms that could enhance developer productivity, customization, and the overall user experience within the project's tooling.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future tooling or development environment choices.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
