# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: Embedding Space

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-096-INTROSPECTION-EMBEDDING-SPACE
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "Embedding Space" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how the concept of mapping high-dimensional data into lower-dimensional vector spaces, while preserving meaningful relationships, might apply to or inform the project's data representation, machine learning models, or similarity search. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for leveraging embedding spaces for efficient data processing and analysis.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore techniques for representing complex data in a more compact and semantically meaningful way, potentially leading to more efficient machine learning models, improved similarity search, and better data understanding.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future data representation or machine learning components.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
