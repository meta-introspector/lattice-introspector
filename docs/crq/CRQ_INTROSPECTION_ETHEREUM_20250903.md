# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: Ethereum

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-064-INTROSPECTION-ETHEREUM
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "Ethereum" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how the principles of smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), programmable blockchains, and the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) might apply to or inform the project's logic execution, decentralized components, or tokenization strategies. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for leveraging Ethereum's capabilities for building trustless and programmable systems.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore the foundational concepts of programmable blockchains and decentralized applications for potential application in building more secure, transparent, and automated systems within the project.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future logic execution, decentralized components, or tokenization features.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
