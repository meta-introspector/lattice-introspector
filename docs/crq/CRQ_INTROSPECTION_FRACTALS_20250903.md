# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: Fractals

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-047-INTROSPECTION-FRACTALS
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "Fractals" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how the principles of self-similarity, iteration, and infinite detail found in fractals might apply to or inform the project's data visualization, procedural generation, or the design of complex, evolving systems. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for creating visually rich outputs or modeling recursive structures.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore mathematical concepts that could provide novel approaches to data representation, visualization, and the generation of intricate patterns within the project, potentially leading to more engaging user experiences or efficient data modeling.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future visualization tools or procedural generation algorithms.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
