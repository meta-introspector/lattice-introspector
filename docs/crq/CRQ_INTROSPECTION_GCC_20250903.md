# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: GCC

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-077-INTROSPECTION-GCC
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how GCC's capabilities (e.g., language support, optimization levels, target architectures, plugin mechanisms) might apply to or inform the project's build process, cross-compilation, or performance tuning. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for leveraging GCC for robust and optimized code generation.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore the capabilities of GCC for potential optimization, integration, and build strategies within the project, ensuring efficient and reliable code compilation.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future build processes or performance optimizations.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
