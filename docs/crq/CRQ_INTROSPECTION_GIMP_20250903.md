# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program)

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-101-INTROSPECTION-GIMP
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program)" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how GIMP's capabilities (e.g., image editing, manipulation, scripting) might apply to or inform the project's visual assets, user interface design, or image processing workflows. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for leveraging GIMP for creating and manipulating 2D visual content.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore 2D image manipulation tools for potential application in building more engaging and visually appealing interfaces or content within the project.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future visual assets or image processing.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
