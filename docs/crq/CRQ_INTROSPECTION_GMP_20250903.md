# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: GMP (GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library)

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-110-INTROSPECTION-GMP
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "GMP (GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library)" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how GMP's capabilities for arbitrary-precision arithmetic might apply to or inform the project's cryptographic operations, scientific computing, or number theory applications. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for leveraging GMP for high-precision numerical computations.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore arbitrary-precision arithmetic solutions for potential application in building more robust and accurate numerical computations within the project, particularly where standard floating-point precision is insufficient.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future numerical computations or cryptographic modules.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
