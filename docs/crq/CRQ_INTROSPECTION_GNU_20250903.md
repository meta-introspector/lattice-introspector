# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: GNU

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-061-INTROSPECTION-GNU
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "GNU" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how the principles of the GNU project (e.g., free software, open source, community collaboration, robust utilities) might apply to or inform the project's licensing, development model, or the utilization of GNU tools and libraries. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for leveraging GNU's philosophy and ecosystem for project development and distribution.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore the principles and tools of the GNU project for potential alignment with the project's values, development practices, and the utilization of a rich ecosystem of free software.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future licensing, development practices, or toolchain choices.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
