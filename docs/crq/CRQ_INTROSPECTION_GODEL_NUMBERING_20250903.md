# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: Gödel Numbering

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-045-INTROSPECTION-GODEL-NUMBERING
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "Gödel Numbering" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how the concept of uniquely encoding formal expressions and proofs as natural numbers might apply to or inform the project's data serialization, unique identification of code constructs, or formal reasoning about program properties. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for representing complex structures numerically for analysis or manipulation.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore foundational mathematical concepts that could provide novel ways to represent and reason about complex data or code structures within the project, potentially leading to more robust analysis or transformation capabilities.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future data representation or analysis tools.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
