# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: Graphviz

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-116-INTROSPECTION-GRAPHVIZ
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "Graphviz" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how Graphviz, a graph visualization software, might apply to or inform the project's data visualization, network analysis, or the generation of diagrams from structured data. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for leveraging Graphviz for creating clear and customizable graph representations.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore graph visualization tools for potential application in building more intuitive and informative data representations within the project, enabling better understanding of complex relationships.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future data visualization or diagram generation.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
