# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: Guix

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-105-INTROSPECTION-GUIX
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "Guix" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how the GNU Guix functional package manager and operating system (e.g., declarative configuration, reproducible builds, transactional upgrades, Scheme-based customization) might apply to or inform the project's development environment, build system, or deployment strategy. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for leveraging Guix for highly reproducible and reliable software management, with a focus on free software principles.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore declarative and reproducible software management solutions for potential application in building more consistent, reliable, and portable development and deployment environments within the project, aligning with free software principles.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future build systems or deployment strategies.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
