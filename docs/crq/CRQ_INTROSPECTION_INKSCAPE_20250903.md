# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: Inkscape

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-102-INTROSPECTION-INKSCAPE
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "Inkscape" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how Inkscape's capabilities (e.g., vector graphics editing, SVG support, scripting) might apply to or inform the project's visual assets, user interface design, or diagram generation. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for leveraging Inkscape for creating and manipulating scalable vector graphics.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore vector graphics tools for potential application in building more scalable and visually appealing interfaces or content within the project.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future visual assets or diagram generation.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
