# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: ISO 9000

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-111-INTROSPECTION-ISO9K
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "ISO 9000" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how the principles of quality management systems (e.g., customer focus, leadership, engagement of people, process approach, improvement, evidence-based decision making, relationship management) might apply to or inform the project's development processes, quality assurance, or organizational structure. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for leveraging ISO 9000 for improving overall project quality and efficiency.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore established quality management frameworks for potential application in building more robust and reliable development processes within the project, ensuring consistent delivery of high-quality software.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future development processes or quality assurance.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
