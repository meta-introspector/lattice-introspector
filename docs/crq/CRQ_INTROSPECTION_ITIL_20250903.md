# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library)

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-112-INTROSPECTION-ITIL
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library)" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how ITIL's framework for IT service management (e.g., service strategy, design, transition, operation, continual service improvement) might apply to or inform the project's operational processes, service delivery, or support mechanisms. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for leveraging ITIL for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of IT services related to the project.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore established IT service management frameworks for potential application in building more robust and efficient operational processes within the project, ensuring consistent delivery of high-quality IT services.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future operational processes or service delivery.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
