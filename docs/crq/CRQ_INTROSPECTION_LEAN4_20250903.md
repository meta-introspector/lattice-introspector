# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: Lean 4

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-054-INTROSPECTION-LEAN4
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "Lean 4" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how this interactive theorem prover and functional programming language might apply to or inform the project's formal verification, proof engineering, or the development of mathematically rigorous software components. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for ensuring correctness and building formally verified systems.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore advanced formal methods and theorem proving capabilities that could enhance the reliability and correctness of critical software components within the project, particularly where mathematical rigor is paramount.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future formal verification efforts or mathematically intensive components.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
