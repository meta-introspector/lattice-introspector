# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: Lie Group

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-049-INTROSPECTION-LIE-GROUP
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "Lie Groups" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how the properties of continuous symmetries and smooth manifolds, as described by Lie groups, might apply to or inform the project's geometric transformations, data manifold learning, or the modeling of continuous system dynamics. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for representing and manipulating continuous symmetries in data or algorithms.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore advanced mathematical concepts that could provide a robust framework for handling continuous symmetries and transformations in data, potentially leading to more sophisticated modeling or analysis capabilities.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future data processing algorithms or geometric modeling.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
