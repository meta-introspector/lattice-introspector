# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: Linked Data

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-091-INTROSPECTION-LINKED-DATA
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "Linked Data" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how the principles of Linked Data (e.g., using URIs as names for things, HTTP URIs, RDF, linking to other data) might apply to or inform the project's data publication, data integration, or semantic interoperability. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for leveraging Linked Data for creating a web of interconnected and machine-readable data.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore data publication and integration strategies for potential application in building more open, interoperable, and machine-readable data ecosystems within the project.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future data publication or integration.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
