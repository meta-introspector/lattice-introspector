# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: Linux

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-062-INTROSPECTION-LINUX
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "Linux" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how the Linux operating system (e.g., kernel features, system calls, file system structure, process management, networking stack) might apply to or inform the project's deployment, performance optimization, or system-level interactions. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for leveraging Linux's capabilities for robust and efficient system operation.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore the capabilities of the Linux operating system for potential optimization, integration, and deployment strategies within the project, ensuring efficient and reliable system operation.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future deployment strategies or system-level optimizations.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
