# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: Lisp

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-058-INTROSPECTION-LISP
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "Lisp" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how the principles of Lisp (e.g., homoiconicity, macros, functional programming, dynamic typing) might apply to or inform the project's architecture, domain-specific languages (DSLs), or metaprogramming capabilities. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for leveraging Lisp's strengths in areas like extensible systems, AI, or rapid prototyping.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore alternative programming paradigms and language features that could offer unique advantages for specific problem domains within the project, particularly in areas requiring high extensibility, metaprogramming, or symbolic computation.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future language choices for specific components or tooling.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
