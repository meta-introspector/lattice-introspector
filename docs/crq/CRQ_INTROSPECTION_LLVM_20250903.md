# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: LLVM

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-078-INTROSPECTION-LLVM
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "LLVM" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how LLVM's modular compiler infrastructure (e.g., intermediate representation, optimization passes, backend targets) might apply to or inform the project's custom language development, static analysis, or code generation. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for leveraging LLVM for flexible and powerful compiler-related tasks.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore the capabilities of LLVM for potential optimization, integration, and build strategies within the project, ensuring efficient and reliable code compilation and analysis.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future build processes, static analysis tools, or custom language development.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
