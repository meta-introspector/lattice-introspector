# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: MiniZinc

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-076-INTROSPECTION-MINIZINC
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "MiniZinc" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how this high-level constraint modeling language and its associated solvers might apply to or inform the project's combinatorial optimization problems, scheduling, or resource allocation. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for leveraging MiniZinc for declarative problem solving and efficient search for optimal solutions.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore declarative modeling approaches for complex combinatorial problems, potentially leading to more efficient and maintainable solutions for optimization tasks within the project.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future optimization algorithms or problem-solving strategies.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
