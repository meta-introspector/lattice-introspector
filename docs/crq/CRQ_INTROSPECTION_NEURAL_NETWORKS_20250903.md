# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: Neural Networks

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-097-INTROSPECTION-NEURAL-NETWORKS
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "Neural Networks" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how various neural network architectures (e.g., ANNs, CNNs, RNNs, Transformers) and their training methodologies might apply to or inform the project's machine learning tasks, pattern recognition, or intelligent decision-making. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for leveraging neural networks for advanced AI capabilities.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore advanced machine learning techniques for potential application in building more intelligent and adaptive systems within the project, enabling capabilities like pattern recognition, prediction, or natural language processing.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future machine learning components or AI features.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
