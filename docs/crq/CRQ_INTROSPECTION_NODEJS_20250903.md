# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: Node.js

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-083-INTROSPECTION-NODEJS
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "Node.js" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how Node.js (e.g., JavaScript runtime, npm ecosystem, asynchronous I/O, server-side development) might apply to or inform the project's backend services, tooling, or cross-platform development. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for leveraging Node.js for scalable and efficient network applications or command-line utilities.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore the capabilities of Node.js for potential backend development, tooling, and cross-platform strategies within the project, ensuring efficient and reliable system operation.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future backend services or development tools.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
