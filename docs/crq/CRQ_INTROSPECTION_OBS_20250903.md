*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-099-INTROSPECTION-OBS
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "OBS (Open Broadcaster Software)" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how OBS's capabilities (e.g., video recording, live streaming, scene composition, audio mixing) might apply to or inform the project's multimedia content generation, presentation, or educational materials. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for leveraging OBS for creating high-quality visual and audio output.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore multimedia content creation tools for potential application in building more engaging and informative presentations or educational materials within the project.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future multimedia content generation or presentation tools.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
