# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: OCaml

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-056-INTROSPECTION-OCAML
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "OCaml" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how this functional programming language, known for its strong type system and performance, might apply to or inform the project's architecture, specific module implementations, or tooling. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for leveraging OCaml's strengths in areas like compilers, theorem provers, or high-performance functional programming.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore alternative programming paradigms and languages that could offer unique advantages for specific problem domains within the project, potentially leading to more robust, maintainable, or performant solutions.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future language choices for specific components.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
