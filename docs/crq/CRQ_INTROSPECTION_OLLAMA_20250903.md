# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: Ollama

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-074-INTROSPECTION-OLLAMA
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "Ollama" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how Ollama, a tool for running large language models (LLMs) locally, might apply to or inform the project's AI integration, local development of AI features, or privacy-preserving AI applications. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for leveraging Ollama for efficient and accessible local LLM inference.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore local LLM deployment solutions for potential application in building more private, efficient, and accessible AI features within the project.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future AI integration or local development workflows.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
