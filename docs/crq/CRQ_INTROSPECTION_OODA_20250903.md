# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: OODA Loop

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-118-INTROSPECTION-OODA
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into the "OODA Loop (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act)" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how this decision-making cycle, originally developed for military combat operations, might apply to or inform the project's agile development processes, incident response, or automated decision systems. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for leveraging the OODA Loop for faster and more effective decision-making in dynamic environments.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore a robust decision-making framework for potential application in building more responsive and adaptive processes within the project, enhancing agility and effectiveness in dynamic situations.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future development processes or automated decision systems.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
