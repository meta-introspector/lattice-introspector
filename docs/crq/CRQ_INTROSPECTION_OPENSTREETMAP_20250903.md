# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: OpenStreetMap

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-108-INTROSPECTION-OPENSTREETMAP
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "OpenStreetMap" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how OpenStreetMap, a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world, might apply to or inform the project's geospatial data handling, location-based services, or mapping functionalities. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for leveraging OpenStreetMap as a source of open and detailed geographic data.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore the capabilities of OpenStreetMap for potential geospatial data integration, location-based services, and mapping functionalities within the project, enabling access to a vast and open geographic database.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future geospatial data handling or location-based services.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
