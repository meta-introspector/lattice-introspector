# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: PlantUML

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-115-INTROSPECTION-PLANTUML
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "PlantUML" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how PlantUML, a tool that allows users to create UML diagrams from a plain text description, might apply to or inform the project's documentation, architectural visualization, or communication processes. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for leveraging PlantUML for easily generating and maintaining diagrams within a text-based workflow.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore text-based diagramming tools for potential application in building more maintainable and version-controllable diagrams within the project, fostering better communication and collaboration.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future documentation or architectural visualization.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
