# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: Quasi Meta Biology and Mycology

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-041-INTROSPECTION-QUASI-META-BIOLOGY-MYCOLOGY
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into the intersection of "quasi meta biology and mycology" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how concepts from these fields (e.g., emergent behavior, decentralized networks, self-organization, fungal networks, biological computation) might relate to or inspire architectural patterns, data structures, or algorithmic approaches within the project. The introspection aims to identify potential analogies, metaphors, or direct applications that could lead to novel solutions or insights.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To foster interdisciplinary thinking and explore unconventional approaches to problem-solving within the project, potentially leading to innovative features or a deeper understanding of complex systems.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future system design or algorithmic choices.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (conceptual exploration).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed analogies.
