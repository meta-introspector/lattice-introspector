# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: RDF (Resource Description Framework)

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-088-INTROSPECTION-RDF
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "RDF (Resource Description Framework)" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how RDF's principles (e.g., triples, URIs, graphs, semantic web technologies) might apply to or inform the project's data modeling, knowledge representation, or semantic interoperability. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for leveraging RDF for structured and interconnected data.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore semantic web technologies for potential application in building more expressive, interoperable, and machine-understandable data models within the project.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future data modeling or knowledge representation.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
