# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: Riemann Manifolds

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-051-INTROSPECTION-RIEMANN-MANIFOLDS
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "Riemann Manifolds" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how the concepts of curved spaces, intrinsic geometry, and geodesics might apply to or inform the project's data analysis (e.g., manifold learning, dimensionality reduction), optimization problems on non-Euclidean spaces, or the modeling of complex data relationships. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for handling data with non-linear structures.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore advanced mathematical concepts that could provide a more sophisticated framework for analyzing and modeling data with complex, non-linear underlying structures, potentially leading to more accurate insights or efficient algorithms.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future data analysis algorithms or optimization techniques.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
