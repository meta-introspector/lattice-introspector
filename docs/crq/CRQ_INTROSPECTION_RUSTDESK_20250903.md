# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: RustDesk

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-098-INTROSPECTION-RUSTDESK
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "RustDesk" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how RustDesk, an open-source remote desktop software, might apply to or inform the project's remote access, collaboration, or support functionalities. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for leveraging RustDesk's capabilities for secure and efficient remote control.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore remote access solutions for potential application in building more efficient and secure collaboration or support features within the project.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future remote access or collaboration tools.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
