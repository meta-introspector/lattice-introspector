# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: Rust

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-053-INTROSPECTION-RUST
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Codebase Analysis
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into the "Rust" programming language's usage within the current project. This involves analyzing the existing Rust codebase for adherence to best practices, idiomatic patterns, performance considerations, and potential areas for refactoring or optimization. The introspection aims to identify opportunities for improving code quality, maintainability, and leveraging advanced Rust features.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To ensure the Rust codebase is robust, efficient, and aligns with modern Rust development standards, contributing to the overall health and longevity of the project.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Existing Rust code modules and their performance.
    *   **Users:** Project developers working with Rust.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is an analysis phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   All Rust source files (`.rs`), `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on analysis and recommendations without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings and proposed changes clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of analysis findings and proposed improvements.
