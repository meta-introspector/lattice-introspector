# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: Scheme

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-059-INTROSPECTION-SCHEME
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "Scheme" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how the principles of Scheme (e.g., minimalism, functional programming, continuations, hygienic macros) might apply to or inform the project's architecture, embedded scripting, or the development of highly extensible components. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for leveraging Scheme's strengths in areas like language design, interpreters, or formal semantics.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore alternative programming paradigms and language features that could offer unique advantages for specific problem domains within the project, particularly in areas requiring simplicity, extensibility, or a strong theoretical foundation.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future language choices for specific components or tooling.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
