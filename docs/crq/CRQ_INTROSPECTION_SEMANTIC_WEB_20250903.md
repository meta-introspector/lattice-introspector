# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: Semantic Web

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-090-INTROSPECTION-SEMANTIC-WEB
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "Semantic Web" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how Semantic Web principles (e.g., linked data, ontologies, reasoning, machine-understandable information) might apply to or inform the project's data integration, knowledge management, or intelligent agent capabilities. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for leveraging Semantic Web technologies for richer data interoperability and automated knowledge processing.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore advanced data integration and knowledge representation paradigms for potential application in building more intelligent, interoperable, and data-driven systems within the project.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future data integration or knowledge management.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
