# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: Semiotics

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-086-INTROSPECTION-SEMIOTICS
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "Semiotics" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how the study of signs and symbols, their interpretation, and their meaning-making processes might apply to or inform the project's user interface design, data representation, or the communication between different system components. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for creating more intuitive, meaningful, and effective interactions and data exchanges.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore the principles of semiotics for potential application in building more intuitive, meaningful, and effective user interfaces and data representations within the project.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future UI/UX design or data representation.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
