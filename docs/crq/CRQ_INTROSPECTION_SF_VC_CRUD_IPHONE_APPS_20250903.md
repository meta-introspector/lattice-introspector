# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: SF VC CRUD (iPhone Apps)

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-043-INTROSPECTION-SF-VC-CRUD-IPHONE-APPS
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "SF VC CRUD (iPhone Apps)" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how concepts related to Salesforce (SF), Version Control (VC), Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations, and iPhone application development might intersect with or inform the project's architecture, data management, or mobile strategy. The introspection aims to identify potential integrations, best practices, or design patterns applicable from these domains.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore potential avenues for mobile application development, data synchronization, and integration with enterprise systems, leveraging established patterns from Salesforce and version control.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future system design or mobile development strategy.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed analogies.
