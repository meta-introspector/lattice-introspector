# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: Solana

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-065-INTROSPECTION-SOLANA
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "Solana" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how the principles of high-throughput blockchain, Proof-of-History, parallel transaction processing, and smart contract development on Solana might apply to or inform the project's performance-critical distributed systems, data processing, or decentralized application strategies. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for leveraging Solana's capabilities for scalable and efficient blockchain operations.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore the foundational concepts of high-performance blockchains and their underlying technologies for potential application in building more scalable, efficient, and decentralized systems within the project.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future distributed system design, data processing, or decentralized application features.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
