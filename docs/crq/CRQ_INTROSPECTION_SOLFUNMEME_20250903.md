*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-067-INTROSPECTION-SOLFUNMEME
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "Solfunmeme" within the context of the current project. This involves analyzing existing components or concepts related to "solfunmeme" (e.g., `solfunmeme-dioxus`, `solfunmeme-metameme`, `solfunmeme-model-builder-quiz`) to understand its current capabilities, underlying principles, and potential for further development or integration. The introspection aims to identify opportunities for new features, improved functionality, or a deeper understanding of the "solfunmeme" concept within the project.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To enhance the understanding and development of the "solfunmeme" concept within the project, leveraging existing components as a foundation for further exploration and integration.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Existing "solfunmeme" related modules and their interactions.
    *   **Users:** Developers working with "solfunmeme" components.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is an introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   `vendor/solfunmeme-dioxus`, `vendor/solfunmeme-metameme`, `vendor/solfunmeme-model-builder-quiz`, and any other related files.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on analysis and design without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings and proposed enhancements clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of analysis findings and proposed improvements.
