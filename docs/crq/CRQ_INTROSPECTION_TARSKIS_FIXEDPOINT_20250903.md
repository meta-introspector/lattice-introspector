# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: Tarski's Fixed-Point Theorem

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-044-INTROSPECTION-TARSKIS-FIXEDPOINT
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "Tarski's Fixed-Point Theorem" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how the mathematical principles of fixed points, especially in lattice theory and order theory, might apply to or inform the project's data structures, algorithms, or formal verification efforts. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for ensuring termination, convergence, or correctness in iterative processes or recursive definitions.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore foundational mathematical concepts that could provide rigorous guarantees for the behavior of complex systems within the project, particularly in areas involving iterative computation or logical consistency.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future algorithm design or formal methods.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
