# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: Terraform

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-070-INTROSPECTION-TERRAFORM
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "Terraform" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how HashiCorp Terraform, an infrastructure as code (IaC) tool, might apply to or inform the project's multi-cloud deployment, infrastructure management, or resource provisioning across various providers. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for leveraging Terraform for automated, consistent, and repeatable infrastructure deployments.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore infrastructure as code solutions for potential application in building more automated, consistent, and scalable deployment pipelines within the project, especially for multi-cloud or hybrid cloud environments.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future deployment strategies or infrastructure management.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
