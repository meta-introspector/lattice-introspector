# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: tmux

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-082-INTROSPECTION-TMUX
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "tmux" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how tmux, a terminal multiplexer, might apply to or inform the project's development environment, remote work setups, or automated task execution. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for leveraging tmux's capabilities for persistent sessions, split panes, and efficient command-line workflows.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore terminal multiplexing solutions for potential application in building more efficient and persistent development environments within the project, enhancing developer productivity and remote collaboration.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future development workflows or remote access strategies.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
