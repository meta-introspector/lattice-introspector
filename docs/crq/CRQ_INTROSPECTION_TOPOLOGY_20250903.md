# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: Topology

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-095-INTROSPECTION-TOPOLOGY
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "Topology" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how the mathematical study of shapes and spaces, and their properties that are preserved under continuous deformations, might apply to or inform the project's data analysis (e.g., topological data analysis), network design, or the modeling of abstract relationships. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for understanding the fundamental structure and connectivity of data or systems.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore advanced mathematical concepts that could provide a robust framework for understanding the fundamental structure and connectivity of data or systems, potentially leading to more insightful analysis or resilient designs.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future data analysis or system design.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
