# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: Turtle (Terse RDF Triple Language)

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-089-INTROSPECTION-TURTLE
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "Turtle (Terse RDF Triple Language)" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how Turtle, a human-friendly syntax for RDF, might apply to or inform the project's data serialization, knowledge representation, or semantic data exchange. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for leveraging Turtle for readable and concise representation of RDF data.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore human-readable RDF serialization formats for potential application in building more accessible and manageable semantic data models within the project.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future data serialization or knowledge representation.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
