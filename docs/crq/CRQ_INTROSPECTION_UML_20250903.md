# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: UML (Unified Modeling Language)

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-114-INTROSPECTION-UML
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "UML (Unified Modeling Language)" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how UML's various diagrams (e.g., class, sequence, activity, use case) might apply to or inform the project's design, documentation, or communication processes. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for leveraging UML for clear and standardized software modeling.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore established software modeling languages for potential application in building more understandable and maintainable software designs within the project, fostering better communication and collaboration.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future software design or documentation.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
