# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: Univalent Foundations

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-046-INTROSPECTION-UNIVALENT-FOUNDATIONS
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "Univalent Foundations" (Homotopy Type Theory) within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how the principles of identity, equality, and proof relevance in univalent foundations might apply to or inform the project's type systems, formal verification, or the representation of mathematical structures within code. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for more rigorous and expressive ways of defining and reasoning about program properties.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore advanced mathematical and logical frameworks that could provide a more robust and expressive foundation for formal reasoning about software, potentially leading to higher levels of correctness and reliability.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future type system design or formal methods.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
