# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: Wikidata

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-107-INTROSPECTION-WIKIDATA
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into "Wikidata" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how Wikidata, a free and open knowledge base that can be read and edited by both humans and machines, might apply to or inform the project's data integration, knowledge representation, or semantic interoperability. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for leveraging Wikidata as a source of structured data and a hub for linked open data.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore the capabilities of Wikidata for potential data integration, knowledge representation, and semantic interoperability within the project, enabling access to a vast and interconnected knowledge base.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future data integration or knowledge representation.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
