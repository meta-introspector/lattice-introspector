# Change Request (CRQ) - Introspection: Zero Ontology System (ZOS1 Token 1 on ETH)

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-066-INTROSPECTION-ZOS1-TOKEN-1-ON-ETH
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Introspection/Research
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ proposes an introspection into the "Zero Ontology System (ZOS1 Token 1 on ETH)" within the context of the current project. This involves exploring how the concept of a minimal, foundational ontology, potentially represented as a token on the Ethereum blockchain, might apply to or inform the project's data modeling, semantic interoperability, or decentralized identity/asset management. The introspection aims to identify potential applications for leveraging ZOS principles for simplified and robust data representation in a decentralized environment.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To explore novel approaches to ontology design and decentralized data representation, potentially leading to more efficient and interoperable data management within the project, especially in blockchain-related contexts.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Primarily conceptual at this stage; potential influence on future data modeling, semantic layers, or blockchain integrations.
    *   **Users:** Project developers and architects.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None directly, as this is a research/introspection phase.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   No direct code changes initially; potential for new design documents or research notes.
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Focus on conceptual exploration without immediate implementation.
    *   Document findings clearly.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   N/A (introspection phase).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Review of research findings and proposed applications.
