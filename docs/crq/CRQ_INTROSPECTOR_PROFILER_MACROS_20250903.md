# Change Request (CRQ) - New introspector_profiler_macros Crate

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-005-INTROSPECTOR-PROFILER-MACROS
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Normal (New Feature/Component)
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ documents the introduction of a new Rust crate, `introspector_profiler_macros`. This crate likely provides procedural macros for profiling or introspection within the Rust codebase. Its addition signifies new capabilities for code analysis or performance monitoring.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    This new component is introduced to enhance the project's profiling and introspection capabilities. This CRQ serves to formally document its addition to ensure compliance with change management procedures.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Rust compilation process, and any crates that will utilize these new macros.
    *   **Users:** Developers working on Rust code who will use or be affected by these macros.
    *   **Potential Risks:** Increased compilation times, unexpected macro expansion behavior, or conflicts with existing code if not properly designed and tested.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   `crates/introspector_profiler_macros/Cargo.toml` (new)
    *   `crates/introspector_profiler_macros/src/` (new directory and its contents)
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Thorough code review of the macro implementation.
    *   Comprehensive unit and integration testing of the macros.
    *   Performance testing to assess impact on compilation times.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   Remove the `crates/introspector_profiler_macros/` directory and its contents.
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Verify that the crate compiles successfully.
    *   Write and run tests for the macros to ensure they function as expected.
    *   Integrate the macros into a test project and verify their behavior.
