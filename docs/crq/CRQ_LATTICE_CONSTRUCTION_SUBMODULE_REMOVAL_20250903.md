# Change Request (CRQ) - lattice/construction Submodule Removal

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-009-LATTICE-CONSTRUCTION-SUBMODULE-REMOVAL
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Normal (Submodule Removal/Integration)
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ documents the formal removal of `lattice/construction` as a Git submodule. As per user confirmation, the contents of `lattice/construction` have been merged directly into the main repository, rendering its submodule status obsolete. This change cleans up the Git repository by removing the outdated submodule reference.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To reflect the integration of `lattice/construction`'s functionality directly into the main project and to clean up the Git repository from an outdated submodule reference, ensuring consistency and accuracy of the project's structure.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Git repository structure. No functional impact is expected as the content has been integrated.
    *   **Users:** Developers working with the `lattice/construction` code.
    *   **Potential Risks:** None, as the content is already integrated.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   `lattice/construction` (removed as submodule, now untracked files)
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Verification that `lattice/construction` content is correctly integrated into the main repository.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   Re-add `lattice/construction` as a submodule if necessary (though this is not expected).
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Confirm that the project builds and functions correctly without `lattice/construction` being a submodule.
