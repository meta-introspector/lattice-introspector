# Change Request (CRQ) - libminizinc (Main Repo) Vendorization

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-019-LIBMINIZINC-MAIN-VENDORIZATION
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Normal (New Vendored Dependency)
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ documents the vendorization of the main `libminizinc` repository from `meta-introspector` as a Git submodule. The repository, specifically `https://github.com/meta-introspector/libminizinc.git/`, will be integrated into this project under the `vendor/libminizinc-main` path, tracking the `feature/community-docs` branch. This provides access to the core `libminizinc` functionalities.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    To incorporate the core `libminizinc` library as a direct dependency, enabling the use of its functionalities and ensuring a stable, version-controlled integration. This also aligns with the project's strategy for managing external dependencies.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Project build process, and any components that will depend on `libminizinc`.
    *   **Users:** Developers working with `libminizinc` components.
    *   **Potential Risks:** Increased repository size, potential for conflicts if `libminizinc` has its own submodules, or issues with build compatibility.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   `.gitmodules` (modified)
    *   `vendor/libminizinc-main` (new submodule)
*   **Associated Commits:** (Will be added after committing)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Verify successful submodule cloning and initialization.
    *   Ensure project builds correctly with the vendored `libminizinc`.
    *   Thorough testing of functionalities relying on `libminizinc`.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   Remove the `vendor/libminizinc-main` submodule entry from `.gitmodules` and `.git/config`.
    *   Remove the `vendor/libminizinc-main` directory.
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Clone the repository and verify that the `vendor/libminizinc-main` submodule initializes correctly.
    *   Build the project and run tests to ensure `libminizinc` integration is successful.
