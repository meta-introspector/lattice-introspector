# CRQ: Pick-Up-Nix Project QA Review and Status Update

**Date:** 2025-09-08

## 1. Introduction

This Change Request (CRQ) initiates a formal Quality Assurance (QA) review and status update for the `pick-up-nix` project. The objective is to assess the current state of the project, identify key QA metrics, and propose steps for integrating it into a robust QA system to ensure its reproducibility, correctness, and maintainability.

## 2. Project Overview (`pick-up-nix`)

`pick-up-nix` serves as a personal repository for Nix configurations, primarily for Android (`nix-on-droid`) and other Linux systems (Ubuntu, GitHub Actions). It leverages a central `flake.nix` for modular configuration management, allowing for different package sets tailored to various use cases.

**Key Components and Structure:**

*   `flake.nix`: Central configuration hub, defining inputs, overlays, and system/home configurations.
*   `home/`: Contains modular Home Manager configurations (`base.nix`, `emacs.nix`, `scientific.nix`).
*   `configurations/`: Top-level modules, e.g., `android.nix` for `nix-on-droid`.
*   `.config/home-manager/`: Shared user-level settings.
*   `shell.nix`: A standalone, non-flake development shell.

**Usage:** Provides `nix-on-droid switch` and `home-manager switch` commands for applying configurations.

**Development Practices:** Development process is livestreamed, and social media links are provided. Includes a vendored `asciinema` flake.

## 3. Current Status Assessment for QA

Based on initial review, the project exhibits good modularity and leverages Nix for reproducibility. However, for formal QA integration, the following aspects require attention:

*   **Reproducibility:** While Nix inherently promotes reproducibility, explicit testing across different environments is crucial.
*   **Correctness of Configurations:** Verification that configurations function as intended on their target systems.
*   **Dependency Management:** Clear processes for managing and updating external dependencies.
*   **Security:** Assessment of security implications of configurations and vendored flakes.
*   **Documentation:** Potential need for more detailed documentation for specific configurations or modules beyond the `README.md`.
*   **Testing:** Understanding and enhancing existing automated testing (e.g., `runtests.sh`).
*   **Build Process:** Reviewing and formalizing the build process (e.g., `build_and_report.sh`).

## 4. Proposed QA Metrics

To effectively track the quality of `pick-up-nix`, the following metrics are proposed:

*   **Successful Build Rate:** Percentage of successful Nix builds for all defined configurations.
*   **Test Pass Rate:** Percentage of passing tests from `runtests.sh` (once understood and potentially expanded).
*   **Configuration Deployment Success Rate:** Percentage of successful deployments of configurations to target environments (e.g., Android, Ubuntu).
*   **Dependency Freshness:** Regular checks for outdated or vulnerable dependencies.
*   **Documentation Coverage:** Metric for the completeness and accuracy of documentation.

## 5. Next Steps for Formal QA Integration

1.  **Examine Existing Test and Build Scripts:** Analyze `runtests.sh` and `build_and_report.sh` to understand current testing and build procedures.
2.  **Propose Automated QA Checks:** Develop a plan to integrate automated checks (e.g., Nix builds, Home Manager checks, linting, static analysis) into a CI/CD pipeline.
3.  **Document Configuration Specifics:** Create more detailed documentation for complex or critical configurations.
4.  **Implement Dependency Auditing:** Set up automated tools for checking dependency freshness and vulnerabilities.

## 6. Immediate Next Action

To proceed with the formal QA integration, the immediate next action is to:

**Examine the content of `runtests.sh` and `build_and_report.sh` to understand the current testing and build procedures.**

## 7. Proposed Automated QA Checks (CI/CD Pipeline)

To ensure continuous quality and adherence to standards, a CI/CD pipeline is proposed with the following structure:

*   **Trigger:** On every push to the repository or pull request.
*   **Stages/Steps:**
    1.  **Checkout Code:** Retrieve the latest version of the `pick-up-nix` repository.
    2.  **Execute Modular QA Tasks (`qa.d/`):** The `build_and_report.sh` script will now orchestrate the execution of individual QA tasks located in the `qa.d/` directory. Each task is a standalone script (e.g., `01_nix_builds.sh`, `02_nix_linters.sh`) executed in numerical order.
    3.  **Report Build Status:** The CI job's success or failure will be determined by the overall exit code of `build_and_report.sh`.
    4.  **Upload QA Report:** The `qa_build_report.txt` will be uploaded as a CI artifact for review and historical tracking.
    5.  **Home Manager Dry-Run (Recommended):** For Home Manager configurations, perform a dry-run (`home-manager switch --flake .#<profile> --dry-run`) to catch potential errors or unexpected changes before actual deployment.

This modular pipeline enhances maintainability and allows for easy addition of new QA checks. It will provide immediate feedback on the health of the Nix configurations and contribute to maintaining a high standard of quality.
