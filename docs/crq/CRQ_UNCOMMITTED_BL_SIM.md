# Change Request (CRQ) - Uncommitted Changes on Blinkenlights Simulation Feature Branch

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-001-UNCOMMITTED
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Normal (assuming, can be adjusted)
*   **Description of Change:**
    This CRQ covers a set of ongoing development changes that are currently uncommitted in the `feature/ultimate-blinkenlights-simulation` branch. These changes involve modifications to existing source code and Python scripts, as well as the introduction of new Rust crates, shell scripts, data directories, and test trace directories.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    These changes are part of active development but have not yet gone through a formal change management process, leading to a state of non-compliance. This CRQ aims to document these changes to bring them under formal control and ensure they meet project standards and regulatory requirements.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** `ultimate_blinkenlights_simulation` functionality, prime resonance generation, and potentially new profiling/testing infrastructure.
    *   **Users:** Developers working on the blinkenlights simulation and related components.
    *   **Potential Risks:** Introduction of bugs, performance regressions, or further non-compliance if not properly reviewed and tested.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   **Modified:**
        *   `crates/ultimate_blinkenlights_simulation/src/main.rs`
        *   `generate_prime_resonances.py`
        *   `vendor/scirs` (submodule content)
    *   **Added (Untracked):**
        *   `#run_blinkenlights.sh#`
        *   `.#run_blinkenlights.sh`
        *   `blinkenlights_output.log`
        *   `crates/introspector_profiler_macros/`
        *   `data/`
        *   `docs/crq/`
        *   `run_blinkenlights.sh`
        *   `run_test_driver.sh`
        *   `test_traces/`
        *   `test_traces_primes/`
*   **Associated Commits:** N/A (These are uncommitted changes)
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Thorough code review of all modified and new files.
    *   Comprehensive testing of affected functionalities.
    *   Adherence to coding standards and best practices.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   Discarding uncommitted changes using `git restore` or `git clean` (if not yet staged/committed).
    *   If committed, using `git revert` to undo the changes.
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Execute existing unit and integration tests for `ultimate_blinkenlights_simulation`.
    *   Develop new tests for `introspector_profiler_macros` and any new functionalities introduced by the scripts.
    *   Verify the correct operation of `run_blinkenlights.sh` and `run_test_driver.sh`.
    *   Confirm that `generate_prime_resonances.py` functions as expected.
