# Change Request (CRQ) - Commit d11dbae: Add ultimate blinkenlights simulation and documentation.

*   **CRQ ID:** TBD-002-d11dbae
*   **Date:** September 3, 2025
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent (on behalf of User)
*   **Change Type:** Normal (Feature Addition)
*   **Description of Change:**
    This change introduces the ultimate blinkenlights simulation, including its core logic and initial documentation. It involves new Rust modules for configuration, image utilities, and slime mold simulation, along with the main application entry point.
*   **Reason for Change (Compliance Link):**
    This feature was developed and committed without a formal CRQ process, leading to a compliance gap. This CRQ serves to formally document the change post-implementation to bring it into compliance with change management procedures.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Systems/Services:** Introduction of a new major feature, the ultimate blinkenlights simulation.
    *   **Users:** Developers and users interested in the blinkenlights simulation.
    *   **Potential Risks:** Potential for new bugs in the simulation logic, or integration issues with other parts of the system.
*   **Affected Files/Components:**
    *   `crates/ultimate_blinkenlights_simulation/Cargo.toml`
    *   `crates/ultimate_blinkenlights_simulation/src/config.rs`
    *   `crates/ultimate_blinkenlights_simulation/src/image_utils.rs`
    *   `crates/ultimate_blinkenlights_simulation/src/main.rs`
    *   `crates/ultimate_blinkenlights_simulation/src/slime_mold.rs`
    *   `ultimate_blinkenlights_simulation.md`
*   **Associated Commits:** `d11dbae4d180ab6e8042d83d719be58773797402`
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Review of the simulation logic and code structure.
    *   Testing of the blinkenlights simulation functionality.
    *   Verification of documentation accuracy.
*   **Rollback Plan:**
    *   `git revert d11dbae4d180ab6e8042d83d719be58773797402`
*   **Testing/Verification Plan:**
    *   Run the blinkenlights simulation to confirm expected behavior.
    *   Verify that the new modules integrate correctly.
    *   Check the documentation for clarity and completeness.
