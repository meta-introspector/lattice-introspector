+# Post-Reboot Instructions for Gemini CLI Agent
+
+## Current State Summary
+
+*   **Primary Goal:** Develop a Rust tool capable of reading, writing, and reporting on "prime resonances."
+*   **Architectural Plan:** Establish a Rust workspace comprising:
+    *   `introspector`: The existing primary crate.
+    *   `resonance_core`: A new library crate designed to encapsulate core data structures (`PrimeResonance`) and fundamental I/O operations (reading/writing resonance data).
+    *   `resonance_analyzer`: A new binary crate intended to serve as the command-line interface (CLI) for the tool, which will depend on `resonance_core` for its core functionalities.
+*   **Development Progress:** All necessary code snippets for the new Rust crates and workspace configuration have been provided to the user. This includes:
+    *   The content for the main workspace `Cargo.toml` (expected location: `/data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/github/rustc/Cargo.toml`).
+    *   The `Cargo.toml` and `src/lib.rs` content for the `resonance_core` crate.
+    *   The `Cargo.toml` and `src/main.rs` content for the `resonance_analyzer` crate.
+    *   The updated workspace-level `.gitignore` file.
+*   **Pending User Action:** The user is required to manually apply these provided file system changes. This is due to the agent\'s current operational limitation, preventing direct write access outside its immediate working directory (`/data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/github/rustc/crates/introspector/`).
+*   **Git State:** There are uncommitted changes in the Git repository stemming from previous, incorrect attempts to set up the workspace and crates. These changes need to be addressed (cleaned up or committed) once the user has performed the manual file system updates.
+
+## Post-Reboot Action Plan
+
+Upon restart, follow these steps to seamlessly resume the development process:
+
+1.  **Re-establish Operational Context:**
+    *   **Verify Current Working Directory:** Confirm that the active directory is still `/data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/github/rustc/crates/introspector/`.
+    *   **Recall Project Meta-Narrative:** Briefly recall the 'zos' concept and 'The Chronos-Code Paradox' to maintain continuity and thematic alignment.
+
+2.  **Confirm Manual File System Updates by User:**
+    *   **Critical Inquiry:** The absolute first step is to ask the user directly: "Have you manually applied all the `Cargo.toml`, `src/lib.rs`, `src/main.rs`, and `.gitignore` changes to their correct locations as previously instructed?"
+    *   **Contingency:** If the user indicates that the changes have not yet been applied, gently remind them of the manual steps required and offer to re-provide the necessary code snippets for their convenience.
+
+3.  **Clean Up Git Repository State:**
+    *   **Initial Assessment:** Once the user confirms the manual file system updates, execute `git status` to assess the current state of the repository.
+    *   **Address Lingering Artifacts:** Identify and guide the user to remove any remaining untracked files or directories, or unstaged changes that resulted from the agent\'s prior incorrect attempts (e.g., `introspector/Cargo.toml` if it still exists, or any `resonance_analyzer/` or `resonance_core/` directories incorrectly placed within `introspector/`). If appropriate and with explicit user consent, suggest using `git clean -fd` (emphasizing its destructive nature).
+
+4.  **Initiate Workspace Build:**
+    *   **Directory Change:** Instruct the user to navigate their terminal to the identified workspace root directory (`/data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/github/rustc/`). This is crucial for `cargo` commands to operate correctly on the entire workspace.
+    *   **Execute Build:** Once in the correct directory, instruct the user to run `cargo build`. This action will compile all crates within the workspace and serve as a primary verification step for the new setup.
+
+5.  **Validate `resonance_analyzer` Functionality:**
+    *   **Execution Command:** Following a successful build, instruct the user to execute the `resonance_analyzer` tool from the workspace root using a command such as `cargo run --package resonance_analyzer -- --prime 23` (or `--prime 5`). This will confirm that the tool is operational and correctly processes input.
+
+6.  **Advance Feature Development:**
+    *   **Next Phase:** Upon successful verification of the basic setup and functionality, proceed to the next phase of development. This involves enhancing the `resonance_core` and `resonance_analyzer` crates to include more advanced features, such as comprehensive resonance writing capabilities and more flexible reporting options, which will likely necessitate further additions to `clap` arguments.

+## Plan: Turning the Poem Back into the Lattice and into Rust
+
+This document outlines the plan for integrating the Zos Axiom poem and its elements more deeply into the Univalent Lattice project, culminating in the generation of Rust code.
+
+### Phase 1: Representing Poem Elements as Lattice Points
+
+-   **Objective:** Create `LatticePoint`s for each numerical element of the Zos poem, capturing their "vibe" and establishing relationships to their corresponding Zos prime `GodelianTruth` points.
+-   **Status (as of last interaction):**
+    -   `ZosPoemElement` `LatticePointKind` has been added to `lattice-types/src/lib.rs`.
+    -   `zos_mapper.rs` in `construction-build-utils` has been modified to generate `LatticePoint`s for each Zos element (0, 1, 2, 3, 5, etc.) with `ZosPoemElement` kind, including their "vibe" descriptions as metadata and relating them to their Zos prime `GodelianTruth` points.
+    -   `ZOS_AXIOM_POEM.md` has been added to the `markdown_paths` in `construction/build.rs` to ensure it\'s introspected as a `MarkdownDocument` `LatticePoint`.
+-   **Verification (Next Steps):**
+    -   Run `cargo check` to ensure all recent code changes compile without errors.
+    -   Run `cargo run -p lattice-macros-test` to execute the test binary.
+    -   Inspect the generated `.gemini/lattice_events` JSON files (specifically the `actual_execution_*.json` and `trace_event_*.json` files) to confirm that the new `ZosPoemElement` `LatticePoint`s are correctly generated with their metadata and relationships.
+
+### Phase 2: Generating Rust Code from the Lattice
+
+-   **Objective:** Develop mechanisms to transform the lattice representation of the poem into executable Rust code. This could involve generating data structures, functions, or even entire modules that reflect the poem\'s structure and meaning.
+-   **Potential Actions:**
+    -   **Define Rust Mappings:** Establish clear mappings between `LatticePoint` kinds (especially `ZosPoemElement` and related `GodelianTruth` points) and corresponding Rust constructs (e.g., enums, structs, constants, functions).
+    -   **Code Generation Logic:** Implement code generation logic within `construction-build-utils` (or a new dedicated crate) that traverses the lattice and emits Rust code based on the defined mappings. This might involve using Rust\'s `proc_macro` capabilities or a simple string-based code generation approach.
+    -   **Integrate with Build Process:** Ensure the Rust code generation is integrated into the existing `build.rs` process, so that the Rust code is automatically generated and compiled as part of the project.
+    -   **Testing Generated Code:** Write unit and integration tests for the generated Rust code to ensure its correctness and adherence to the poem\'s intended logic.
+
+### Phase 3: Deeper Integration and Poetic Interpretation (Future Work)
+
+-   **Objective:** Explore more nuanced ways to represent the poem within the lattice, potentially capturing its narrative flow, metaphorical connections, or even generating new poetic expressions based on lattice states.
+-   **Potential Actions:**
+    -   Develop a mechanism to represent the *structure* of the poem (e.g., stanzas, lines) as `LatticePoint`s, with relationships defining their order and hierarchy.
+    -   Implement a "poetic transformation" that can analyze the "vibe" of different parts of the lattice and generate new poetic text.
+    -   Create a visualization tool that can render the poem\'s `LatticePoint`s and their relationships, allowing for a visual exploration of the "rhyme of the lattice."
+```

+## Refactoring `zos_mapper.rs` into Modular Components
+
+**Goal:** Improve modularity, readability, and maintainability of `zos_mapper.rs` by splitting its functions into separate, focused modules.
+
+**Overall Strategy:**
+The `zos_mapper.rs` file contains several distinct functions responsible for generating different types of `LatticePoint`s and related data. We will refactor these functions into individual modules within a new `zos_mapper_modules` directory.
+
+**Assigned Agents:** Four copies of Gemini CLI Agent (Agent A, Agent B, Agent C, Agent D).
+
+---
+
+### Agent A: `generate_zos_poem_points_code` Module
+
+*   **Task:** Extract the `generate_zos_poem_points_code` function into a new file: `lattice/construction-build-utils/src/zos_mapper_modules/generate_zos_poem_points.rs`.
+*   **Details:**
+    *   Move the function definition and its internal logic.
+    *   Ensure all necessary `use` statements (e.g., `HashMap`, `LatticePoint`, `LatticePointKind`, `quote`, `format_ident`, `fs`, `GenerationContext`) are present in the new module.
+    *   Ensure the `zos_primes` and `zos_archetypes` data are moved with the function.
+    *   Make the function `pub`.
+*   **Verification:** Ensure the new module compiles independently (if possible) and that the original `zos_mapper.rs` can correctly import and use it.
+
+---
+
+### Agent B: `map_source_file_to_zos_prime` and `create_source_file_lattice_point` Modules
+
+*   **Task:** Extract `map_source_file_to_zos_prime` into `lattice/construction-build-utils/src/zos_mapper_modules/map_source_file_to_zos_prime.rs` and `create_source_file_lattice_point` into `lattice/construction-build-utils/src/zos_mapper_modules/create_source_file_lattice_point.rs`.
+*   **Details:**
+    *   Move function definitions and their internal logic.
+    *   Ensure all necessary `use` statements (e.g., `HashMap`, `LatticePoint`, `LatticePointKind`) are present in the new modules.
+    *   Make the functions `pub`.
+*   **Verification:** Ensure the new modules compiles independently and that the original `zos_mapper.rs` can correctly import and use them.
+
+---
+
+### Agent C: `get_zos_prime_keywords` Module
+
+*   **Task:** Extract the `get_zos_prime_keywords` function into a new file: `lattice/construction-build-utils/src/zos_mapper_modules/get_zos_prime_keywords.rs`.
+*   **Details:**
+    *   Move the function definition and its internal logic (the `HashMap` insertion).
+    *   Ensure necessary `use` statements (e.g., `HashMap`) are present.
+    *   Make the function `pub`.
+*   **Verification:** Ensure the new module compiles independently and that the original `zos_mapper.rs` can correctly import and use it.
+
+---
+
+### Agent D: `generate_prime_resonance_points_code` Module
+
+*   **Task:** Extract the `generate_prime_resonance_points_code` function into a new file: `lattice/construction-build-utils/src/zos_mapper_modules/generate_prime_resonance_points.rs`.
+*   **Details:**
+    *   Move the function definition and its internal logic.
+    *   Ensure all necessary `use` statements (e.g., `HashMap`, `LatticePoint`, `LatticePointKind`, `serde_json`, `PathBuf`, `fs`, `quote`, `format_ident`, `GenerationContext`) are present in the new module.
+    *   Ensure the `zos_primes_data` array is moved with the function.
+    *   Make the function `pub`.
+*   **Verification:** Ensure the new module compiles independently and that the original `zos_mapper.rs` can correctly import and use it.
+
+---
+
+**Final Integration (All Agents - Collaborative Task):**
+
+*   **Update `lattice/construction-build-utils/src/zos_mapper.rs`:**
+    *   Remove all original function definitions.
+    *   Add `mod zos_mapper_modules;`
+    *   Add `pub use zos_mapper_modules::generate_zos_poem_points::generate_zos_poem_points_code;` (and similar for all other functions).
+    *   Remove any redundant `use` statements.
+*   **Update `lattice/construction-build-utils/src/lib.rs`:**
+    *   Adjust calls to `zos_mapper` functions to reflect their new module structure (e.g., `zos_mapper::generate_zos_poem_points::generate_zos_poem_points_code(&mut context);`).
+*   **Update `lattice/lattice-macros/src/lib.rs`, `lattice/construction-build-utils/src/generators/binary.rs`, `lattice/construction-build-utils/src/generators/predicted_execution.rs`:**
+    *   Ensure all `match` statements that handle `LatticePointKind` are updated to include `PrimeResonance` and `WordResonance`. (Already done, but double-check after refactoring).
+*   **Run Comprehensive Tests:** Execute `cargo clean` followed by `timeout 1m cargo run -p lattice-macros-test` to ensure the entire project compiles and runs correctly, and that all `LatticePoint`s (including `PrimeResonance` and `WordResonance`) are correctly generated and registered.

+# SOP: Frequency Analysis of `prime_resonance_23.json`
+
+## 1. Introduction
+
+This document details the steps taken to perform a frequency analysis on the `prime_resonance_23.json` file, located at `.gemini/prime_resonances/prime_resonance_23.json`. The goal of this analysis was to understand the structure and content of this "huge file" by identifying patterns and counting occurrences of various fields.
+
+## 2. Tools Used
+
+The following command-line tools were utilized for this analysis:
+
+*   **`gron`**: Flattens JSON into discrete, greppable lines.
+*   **`jq`**: A lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor.
+*   **`grep`**: Filters lines based on patterns.
+*   **`cut`**: Extracts sections from each line of files.
+*   **`sort`**: Sorts lines of text files.
+*   **`uniq -c`**: Reports or omits repeated lines, with `-c` prefixing lines by the number of occurrences.
+*   **`sed`**: A stream editor for filtering and transforming text.
+*   **`tr`**: Translates or deletes characters.
+
+## 3. Analysis Steps and Findings
+
+### 3.1. Initial Inspection with `gron`
+
+The first step was to inspect the structure of the JSON file using `gron`. This helps in understanding the keys and the nesting of the data.
+
+**Command:**
+```bash
+grongr /data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/github/rustc/crates/introspector/.gemini/prime_resonances/prime_resonance_23.json | head -n 20
+```
+
+**Finding:**
+The file is an array of objects, with each object containing `file_path`, `line_number`, and `matched_content` fields. It was also noted that `gron` was not initially installed and had to be installed using `pkg install gron`.
+
+### 3.2. Counting Occurrences of `file_path`
+
+To understand which files are most frequently referenced as "prime resonances", we counted the occurrences of each `file_path`.
+
+**Command:**
+```bash
+grongr /data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/github/rustc/crates/introspector/.gemini/prime_resonances/prime_resonance_23.json | grep '.file_path =' | cut -d'=' -f2 | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
+```
+
+**Finding:**
+The analysis revealed that the `prime_resonance_23.json` file primarily references other `prime_resonance_*.json` files (e.g., `prime_resonance_7.json`, `prime_resonance_19.json`), suggesting an interconnected or hierarchical structure within the prime resonance data. Some source code files and `lattice_events` files were also referenced, but less frequently.
+
+### 3.3. Analyzing Word Frequency in `matched_content`
+
+To gain insight into the textual content of the "resonances", we extracted and counted the most frequent words within the `matched_content` field.
+
+**Command:**
+```bash
+grongr /data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/github/rustc/crates/introspector/.gemini/prime_resonances/prime_resonance_23.json | grep '.matched_content =' | cut -d'=' -f2- | sed 's/[^a-zA-Z ]//g' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr -s ' ' '\n' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n 20
+```
+
+**Finding:**
+The most frequent words included terms like `tostring`, `metadata`, `latticetypes`, `latticepoint`, `insert`, `lattice`, `new`, `addpoint`, `matchedcontent`, `hashmap`, `latticepointkind`, `pub`, `fn`, `let`, `mut`, and `vec`. This strongly suggests that the `matched_content` often contains Rust code snippets related to a "lattice" data structure, its points, and associated metadata. The presence of `matchedcontent` itself was noted as a meta-observation.
+
+### 3.4. Counting Occurrences of `line_number`
+
+We then analyzed the frequency of `line_number` to see if certain lines were more "resonant" across different files.
+
+**Command:**
+```bash
+grongr /data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/github/rustc/crates/introspector/.gemini/prime_resonances/prime_resonance_23.json | grep '.line_number =' | cut -d'=' -f2 | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n 20
+```
+
+**Finding:**
+Lower line numbers (e.g., 2, 4, 6) appeared more frequently, suggesting that "prime resonances" might often occur at the beginning of files, possibly due to common boilerplate or frequently used code.
+
+### 3.5. Counting `file_path` and `line_number` Combinations with `jq`
+
+To get a more precise understanding of where resonances occur, we attempted to count unique `file_path` and `line_number` combinations. Initial attempts with `grep` and `cut` were problematic due to `gron`'s output format. `jq` was then used for more robust JSON parsing.
+
+**Command:**
+```bash
+jq -r '.[] | "\(.file_path) \(.line_number)"' /data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/github/rustc/crates/introspector/.gemini/prime_resonances/prime_resonance_23.json | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n 20
+```
+
+**Finding:**
+Almost all `file_path` and `line_number` combinations appeared only once within `prime_resonance_23.json`. This indicates that the file primarily records unique resonance locations, rather than multiple resonances at the same exact spot. This suggests `prime_resonance_23.json` is an aggregation of unique resonance events.
+
+### 3.6. Filtering `matched_content` for "lattice" (excluding nested JSON)
+
+Due to the presence of deeply nested and escaped JSON within `matched_content`, a direct `grep` for "lattice" was yielding complex, multi-escaped strings. To get cleaner, more meaningful results, we filtered out `matched_content` entries that themselves contained the `\"matched_content\": \"` pattern.
+
+**Command:**
+```bash
+jq -r '.[] | .matched_content' /data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/github/rustc/crates/introspector/.gemini/prime_resonances/prime_resonance_23.json | grep -i 'lattice' | grep -v '\\"matched_content\\": \\"' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n 20
+```
+
+**Finding:**
+This refined filtering provided clearer insights:
+*   Many entries were `file_path` references to JSON files within `.gemini/lattice_events/`, indicating that `prime_resonance_23.json` heavily references event traces related to the "lattice" system.
+*   Specific, human-readable messages like `"Lattice macros test application started."` were found.
+*   Rust code snippets, such as `#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq, Hash, LatticePointDerive)]`, confirmed the strong connection to Rust code and the "lattice" concept.
+
+## 4. Conclusion
+
+The `prime_resonance_23.json` file serves as a record of unique "prime resonances" across the project. These resonances are often tied to specific file paths and line numbers, and their `matched_content` can range from simple text to complex, nested JSON structures representing other lattice points or system events. The analysis highlights the project\'s focus on Rust development and the central role of the "lattice" concept within its codebase. The nested nature of the `matched_content` suggests a sophisticated introspection and data logging mechanism.

++This document details the steps taken to perform a frequency analysis on the `prime_resonance_23.json` file, located at `.gemini/prime_resonances/prime_resonance_23.json`. The goal of this analysis was to understand the structure and content of this \"huge file\" by identifying patterns and counting occurrences of various fields.\n++\n++## 2. Tools Used\n++\n++The following command-line tools were utilized for this analysis:\n++\n++*   **`gron`**: Flattens JSON into discrete, greppable lines.\n++*   **`jq`**: A lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor.\n++*   **`grep`**: Filters lines based on patterns.\n++*   **`cut`**: Extracts sections from each line of files.\n++*   **`sort`**: Sorts lines of text files.\n++*   **`uniq -c`**: Reports or omits repeated lines, with `-c` prefixing lines by the number of occurrences.\n++*   **`sed`**: A stream editor for filtering and transforming text.\n++*   **`tr`**: Translates or deletes characters.\n++\n++## 3. Analysis Steps and Findings\n++\n++### 3.1. Initial Inspection with `gron`\n++\n++The first step was to inspect the structure of the JSON file using `gron`. This helps in understanding the keys and the nesting of the data.\n++\n++**Command:**\n++```bash\n++grongr /data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/github/rustc/crates/introspector/.gemini/prime_resonances/prime_resonance_23.json | head -n 20\n++```\n++\n++**Finding:**\n+The file is an array of objects, with each object containing `file_path`, `line_number`, and `matched_content` fields. It was also noted that `gron` was not initially installed and had to be installed using `pkg install gron`.\n++\n++### 3.2. Counting Occurrences of `file_path`\n++\n++To understand which files are most frequently referenced as \"prime resonances\", we counted the occurrences of each `file_path`.\n++\n++**Command:**\n++```bash\n++grongr /data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/github/rustc/crates/introspector/.gemini/prime_resonances/prime_resonance_23.json | grep \'.file_path =\' | cut -d\'=\' -f2 | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr\n++```\n++\n++**Finding:**\n+The analysis revealed that the `prime_resonance_23.json` file primarily references other `prime_resonance_*.json` files (e.g., `prime_resonance_7.json`, `prime_resonance_19.json`), suggesting an interconnected or hierarchical structure within the prime resonance data. Some source code files and `lattice_events` files were also referenced, but less frequently.\n++\n++### 3.3. Analyzing Word Frequency in `matched_content`\n++\n++To gain insight into the textual content of the \"resonances\", we extracted and counted the most frequent words within the `matched_content` field.\n++\n++**Command:**\n++```bash\n++grongr /data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/github/rustc/crates/introspector/.gemini/prime_resonances/prime_resonance_23.json | grep \'.matched_content =\' | cut -d\'=\' -f2- | sed \'s/[^a-zA-Z ]//g\' | tr \'[:upper:]\' \'[:lower:]\' | tr -s \' \' \'\\n\' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n 20\n++```\n++\n++**Finding:**\n+The most frequent words included terms like `tostring`, `metadata`, `latticetypes`, `latticepoint`, `insert`, `lattice`, `new`, `addpoint`, `matchedcontent`, `hashmap`, `latticepointkind`, `pub`, `fn`, `let`, `mut`, and `vec`. This strongly suggests that the `matched_content` often contains Rust code snippets related to a \"lattice\" data structure, its points, and associated metadata. The presence of `matchedcontent` itself was noted as a meta-observation.\n++\n++### 3.4. Counting Occurrences of `line_number`\n++\n++We then analyzed the frequency of `line_number` to see if certain lines were more \"resonant\" across different files.\n++\n++**Command:**\n++```bash\n++grongr /data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/github/rustc/crates/introspector/.gemini/prime_resonances/prime_resonance_23.json | grep \'.line_number =\' | cut -d\'=\' -f2 | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n 20\n++```\n++\n++**Finding:**\n++Lower line numbers (e.g., 2, 4, 6) appeared more frequently, suggesting that \"prime resonances\" might often occur at the beginning of files, possibly due to common boilerplate or frequently used code.\n++\n++### 3.5. Counting `file_path` and `line_number` Combinations with `jq`\n++\n++To get a more precise understanding of where resonances occur, we attempted to count unique `file_path` and `line_number` combinations. Initial attempts with `grep` and `cut` were problematic due to `gron`\'s output format. `jq` was then used for more robust JSON parsing.\n++\n++**Command:**\n++```bash\n++jq -r \'.[] | \"\\(.file_path) \\(.line_number)\"\' /data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/github/rustc/crates/introspector/.gemini/prime_resonances/prime_resonance_23.json | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n 20\n++```\n++\n++**Finding:**\n++Almost all `file_path` and `line_number` combinations appeared only once within `prime_resonance_23.json`. This indicates that the file primarily records unique resonance locations, rather than multiple resonances at the same exact spot. This suggests `prime_resonance_23.json` is an aggregation of unique resonance events.\n++\n++### 3.6. Filtering `matched_content` for \"lattice\" (excluding nested JSON)\n++\n++Due to the presence of deeply nested and escaped JSON within `matched_content`, a direct `grep` for \"lattice\" was yielding complex, multi-escaped strings. To get cleaner, more meaningful results, we filtered out `matched_content` entries that themselves contained the `\\\"matched_content\\\": \\\"` pattern.\n++\n++**Command:**\n++```bash\n++jq -r \'.[] | .matched_content\' /data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/github/rustc/crates/introspector/.gemini/prime_resonances/prime_resonance_23.json | grep -i \'lattice\' | grep -v \'\\\\\"matched_content\\\\\": \\\\\"\' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n 20\n++```\n++\n++**Finding:**\n++This refined filtering provided clearer insights:\n++*   Many entries were `file_path` references to JSON files within `.gemini/lattice_events/`, indicating that `prime_resonance_23.json` heavily references event traces related to the \"lattice\" system.\n++*   Specific, human-readable messages like `\"Lattice macros test application started.\"` were found.\n++*   Rust code snippets, such as `#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq, Hash, LatticePointDerive)]`, confirmed the strong connection to Rust code and the \"lattice\" concept.\n++\n++## 4. Conclusion\n++\n++The `prime_resonance_23.json` file serves as a record of unique \"prime resonances\" across the project. These resonances are often tied to specific file paths and line numbers, and their `matched_content` can range from simple text to complex, nested JSON structures representing other lattice points or system events. The analysis highlights the project\'s focus on Rust development and the central role of the \"lattice\" concept within its codebase. The nested nature of the `matched_content` suggests a sophisticated introspection and data logging mechanism.\n++```\n\n### File: git_log_markdown_changes.md\n```diff\ndiff --git a/git_log_markdown_changes.md b/git_log_markdown_changes.md\nnew file mode 100644\nindex 0000000..c90e3d3\n--- /dev/null\n+++ b/git_log_markdown_changes.md\n@@ -0,0 +1,256 @@\n+# Git Log Markdown Changes (Last 3 Commits)\n+\n+This document summarizes changes made to markdown files in the last 3 git commits.\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Commit: 64b8376755094f2f389ac437985f541e1dae0279\n+**Author:** mike dupont <h4@solfunmeme.com>\n+**Date:** Wed Sep 3 10:03:48 2025 -0400\n+**Message:** Add boot.md and integrate resonance crates.\n+\n+### File: boot.md\n+```diff\n+--- /dev/null\n++++ b/boot.md\n+@@ -0,0 +1,42 @@\n++# Post-Reboot Instructions for Gemini CLI Agent\n++\n++## Current State Summary\n++\n++*   **Primary Goal:** Develop a Rust tool capable of reading, writing, and reporting on "prime resonances."\n++*   **Architectural Plan:** Establish a Rust workspace comprising:\n++    *   `introspector`: The existing primary crate.\n++    *   `resonance_core`: A new library crate designed to encapsulate core data structures (`PrimeResonance`) and fundamental I/O operations (reading/writing resonance data).\n++    *   `resonance_analyzer`: A new binary crate intended to serve as the command-line interface (CLI) for the tool, which will depend on `resonance_core` for its core functionalities.\n++*   **Development Progress:** All necessary code snippets for the new Rust crates and workspace configuration have been provided to the user.

Counting Occurrences of `file_path`\n++\n++To understand which files are most frequently referenced as \"prime resonances\", we counted the occurrences of each `file_path`.\n++\n++**Command:**\n++```bash\n++grongr /data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/github/rustc/crates/introspector/.gemini/prime_resonances/prime_resonance_23.json | grep \'.file_path =\' | cut -d\'=\' -f2 | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr\n++```\n++\n++**Finding:**\n+The analysis revealed that the `prime_resonance_23.json` file primarily references other `prime_resonance_*.json` files (e.g., `prime_resonance_7.json`, `prime_resonance_19.json`), suggesting an interconnected or hierarchical structure within the prime resonance data. Some source code files and `lattice_events` files were also referenced, but less frequently.\n++\n++### 3.3. Analyzing Word Frequency in `matched_content`\n++\n++To gain insight into the textual content of the \"resonances\", we extracted and counted the most frequent words within the `matched_content` field.\n++\n++**Command:**\n++```bash\n++grongr /data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/github/rustc/crates/introspector/.gemini/prime_resonances/prime_resonance_23.json | grep \'.matched_content =\' | cut -d\'=\' -f2- | sed \'s/[^a-zA-Z ]//g\' | tr \'[:upper:]\' \'[:lower:]\' | tr -s \' \' \'\\n\' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n 20\n++```\n++\n++**Finding:**\n+The most frequent words included terms like `tostring`, `metadata`, `latticetypes`, `latticepoint`, `insert`, `lattice`, `new`, `addpoint`, `matchedcontent`, `hashmap`, `latticepointkind`, `pub`, `fn`, `let`, `mut`, and `vec`. This strongly suggests that the `matched_content` often contains Rust code snippets related to a \"lattice\" data structure, its points, and associated metadata. The presence of `matchedcontent` itself was noted as a meta-observation.\n++\n++### 3.4. Counting Occurrences of `line_number`\n++\n++We then analyzed the frequency of `line_number` to see if certain lines were more \"resonant\" across different files.\n++\n++**Command:**\n++```bash\n++grongr /data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/github/rustc/crates/introspector/.gemini/prime_resonances/prime_resonance_23.json | grep \'.line_number =\' | cut -d\'=\' -f2 | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n 20\n++```\n++\n++**Finding:**\n++Lower line numbers (e.g., 2, 4, 6) appeared more frequently, suggesting that \"prime resonances\" might often occur at the beginning of files, possibly due to common boilerplate or frequently used code.\n++\n++### 3.5. Counting `file_path` and `line_number` Combinations with `jq`\n++\n++To get a more precise understanding of where resonances occur, we attempted to count unique `file_path` and `line_number` combinations. Initial attempts with `grep` and `cut` were problematic due to `gron`\'s output format. `jq` was then used for more robust JSON parsing.\n++\n++**Command:**\n++```bash\n++jq -r \'.[] | \"\\(.file_path) \\(.line_number)\"\' /data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/github/rustc/crates/introspector/.gemini/prime_resonances/prime_resonance_23.json | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n 20\n++```\n++\n++**Finding:**\n++Almost all `file_path` and `line_number` combinations appeared only once within `prime_resonance_23.json`. This indicates that the file primarily records unique resonance locations, rather than multiple resonances at the same exact spot. This suggests `prime_resonance_23.json` is an aggregation of unique resonance events.\n++\n++### 3.6. Filtering `matched_content` for \"lattice\" (excluding nested JSON)\n++\n++Due to the presence of deeply nested and escaped JSON within `matched_content`, a direct `grep` for \"lattice\" was yielding complex, multi-escaped strings. To get cleaner, more meaningful results, we filtered out `matched_content` entries that themselves contained the `\\\"matched_content\\\": \\\"` pattern.\n++\n++**Command:**\n++```bash\n++jq -r \'.[] | .matched_content\' /data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/github/rustc/crates/introspector/.gemini/prime_resonances/prime_resonance_23.json | grep -i \'lattice\' | grep -v \'\\\\\"matched_content\\\\\": \\\\\"\' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n 20\n++```\n++\n++**Finding:**\n++This refined filtering provided clearer insights:\n++*   Many entries were `file_path` references to JSON files within `.gemini/lattice_events/`, indicating that `prime_resonance_23.json` heavily references event traces related to the \"lattice\" system.\n++*   Specific, human-readable messages like `\"Lattice macros test application started.\"` were found.\n++*   Rust code snippets, such as `#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq, Hash, LatticePointDerive)]`, confirmed the strong connection to Rust code and the \"lattice\" concept.\n++\n++## 4. Conclusion\n++\n++The `prime_resonance_23.json` file serves as a record of unique \"prime resonances\" across the project. These resonances are often tied to specific file paths and line numbers, and their `matched_content` can range from simple text to complex, nested JSON structures representing other lattice points or system events. The analysis highlights the project\'s focus on Rust development and the central role of the \"lattice\" concept within its codebase. The nested nature of the `matched_content` suggests a sophisticated introspection and data logging mechanism.\n++```\n\n### File: git_log_markdown_changes.md\n```diff\ndiff --git a/git_log_markdown_changes.md b/git_log_markdown_changes.md\nnew file mode 100644\nindex 0000000..c90e3d3\n--- /dev/null\n+++ b/git_log_markdown_changes.md\n@@ -0,0 +1,256 @@\n+# Git Log Markdown Changes (Last 3 Commits)\n+\n+This document summarizes changes made to markdown files in the last 3 git commits.\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Commit: 64b8376755094f2f389ac437985f541e1dae0279\n+**Author:** mike dupont <h4@solfunmeme.com>\n+**Date:** Wed Sep 3 10:03:48 2025 -0400\n+**Message:** Add boot.md and integrate resonance crates.\n+\n+### File: boot.md\n+```diff\n+--- /dev/null\n++++ b/boot.md\n+@@ -0,0 +1,42 @@\n++# Post-Reboot Instructions for Gemini CLI Agent\n++\n++## Current State Summary\n++\n++*   **Primary Goal:** Develop a Rust tool capable of reading, writing, and reporting on "prime resonances."\n++*   **Architectural Plan:** Establish a Rust workspace comprising:\n++    *   `introspector`: The existing primary crate.\n++    *   `resonance_core`: A new library crate designed to encapsulate core data structures (`PrimeResonance`) and fundamental I/O operations (reading/writing resonance data).\n++    *   `resonance_analyzer`: A new binary crate intended to serve as the command-line interface (CLI) for the tool, which will depend on `resonance_core` for its core functionalities.\n++*   **Development Progress:** All necessary code snippets for the new Rust crates and workspace configuration have been provided to the user. This includes:\n++    *   The content for the main workspace `Cargo.toml` (expected location: `/data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/github/rustc/Cargo.toml`).\n++    *   The `Cargo.toml` and `src/lib.rs` content for the `resonance_core` crate.\n++    *   The `Cargo.toml` and `src/main.rs` content for the `resonance_analyzer` crate.\n++    *   The updated workspace-level `.gitignore` file.\n++*   **Pending User Action:** The user is required to manually apply these provided file system changes.

++# SOP: Frequency Analysis of `prime_resonance_23.json`
++
++## 1. Introduction
++
++This document details the steps taken to perform a frequency analysis on the `prime_resonance_23.json` file, located at `.gemini/prime_resonances/prime_resonance_23.json`. The goal of this analysis was to understand the structure and content of this \"huge file\" by identifying patterns and counting occurrences of various fields.\n++\n++## 2. Tools Used\n++\n++The following command-line tools were utilized for this analysis:\n++\n++*   **`gron`**: Flattens JSON into discrete, greppable lines.\n++*   **`jq`**: A lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor.\n++*   **`grep`**: Filters lines based on patterns.\n++*   **`cut`**: Extracts sections from each line of files.\n++*   **`sort`**: Sorts lines of text files.\n++*   **`uniq -c`**: Reports or omits repeated lines, with `-c` prefixing lines by the number of occurrences.\n++*   **`sed`**: A stream editor for filtering and transforming text.\n++*   **`tr`**: Translates or deletes characters.\n++\n++## 3. Analysis Steps and Findings\n++\n++### 3.1. Initial Inspection with `gron`\n++\n++The first step was to inspect the structure of the JSON file using `gron`. This helps in understanding the keys and the nesting of the data.\n++\n++**Command:**\n++```bash\n++grongr /data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/github/rustc/crates/introspector/.gemini/prime_resonances/prime_resonance_23.json | head -n 20\n++```\n++\n++**Finding:**\n+The file is an array of objects, with each object containing `file_path`, `line_number`, and `matched_content` fields. It was also noted that `gron` was not initially installed and had to be installed using `pkg install gron`.\n++\n++### 3.2. Counting Occurrences of `file_path`\n++\n++To understand which files are most frequently referenced as \"prime resonances\", we counted the occurrences of each `file_path`.\n++\n++**Command:**\n++```bash\n++grongr /data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/github/rustc/crates/introspector/.gemini/prime_resonances/prime_resonance_23.json | grep \'.file_path =\' | cut -d\'=\' -f2 | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr\n++```\n++\n++**Finding:**\n+The analysis revealed that the `prime_resonance_23.json` file primarily references other `prime_resonance_*.json` files (e.g., `prime_resonance_7.json`, `prime_resonance_19.json`), suggesting an interconnected or hierarchical structure within the prime resonance data.
