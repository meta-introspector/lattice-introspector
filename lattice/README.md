# Lattice Project

This repository contains the `lattice` project, a collection of Rust crates that form the foundational "genesis block" for a system focused on extreme modularity, computational self-awareness, and verifiable truth. It embodies a "quasi meta reflection model" to provide a structured and reduced context for understanding and evolving complex systems, particularly in the domain of Rust compilation, execution, and introspection.

## Next Steps

To further enhance the lattice and its ability to capture and verify computational truth, the following areas are identified for future development:

### 1. Comprehensive Event Mapping

*   **Log Events:** While basic structured logging is implemented, further refinement can include:
    *   Capturing richer metadata (e.g., module path, thread ID, span context).
    *   Establishing explicit relationships between log events and the `ActualExecution` point they belong to, or even specific code locations.
*   **System Calls:** Mapping system calls into the lattice is a complex endeavor due to its operating system-dependent nature. This would likely require:
    *   Platform-specific tracing mechanisms (e.g., `ptrace` on Linux, DTrace on macOS, ETW on Windows).
    *   Potentially custom kernel modules or eBPF programs for low-level interception.
    *   This area requires significant research and specialized tooling beyond a pure Rust user-space solution.
*   **Print Statements:** Capturing raw `println!` output and mapping it to lattice points is challenging for structured analysis. Future work could explore:
    *   Runtime redirection of `stdout`/`stderr` to a custom parser.
    *   Encouraging the use of the structured logging system (`log` crate) for all output to ensure consistent lattice integration.

### 2. Enhanced Lattice Analyzer

*   **Sophisticated Distance Metric:** Develop a more nuanced distance calculation (`e`) between `PredictedExecution` and `ActualExecution` points, considering factors beyond just binary path and arguments (e.g., sequence of log events, resource usage).
*   **Visualization:** Implement tools for visualizing the lattice, allowing for intuitive exploration of relationships between code, build artifacts, execution traces, and events.
*   **Comprehensive Analysis:** Extend the analyzer to process all `ActualExecution` points (not just the latest) and compare them against their corresponding `PredictedExecution` points, enabling historical analysis and trend identification.

### 3. Runtime Lattice Interaction

*   **Dynamic Lattice Updates:** Explore mechanisms for runtime updates to the lattice, allowing running programs to add or modify lattice points and relationships dynamically.
*   **Querying the Lattice:** Develop an API or query language for interacting with the lattice at runtime, enabling programs to introspect their own computational context.
